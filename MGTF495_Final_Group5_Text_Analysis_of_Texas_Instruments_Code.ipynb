With each generation, technology has become more reliable, more affordable and\\nlower in power, with semiconductors used by a growing number of customers and markets. Our passion continues to \\nbe alive today, as we help customers develop electronics and new applications, particularly in industrial and automotive\\nmarkets. \\nOur founders had the foresight to know that passion alone was not enough and that building a great company required\\na special culture to thrive for the long term. For many years, we’ve run our business with three overarching ambitions in \\nmind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world\\nthat’s ever changing. And third, we will be a company that we’re personally proud to be a part of and would want as our \\nneighbor. When we’re successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders \\nall win.\\nOur commitment to being a good corporate citizen\\nWe take great pride in our commitment to being a good corporate citizen, which impacts our communities and the world \\nin two ways. First, our ambitions guide how we run our business and are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a \\nsustainable, socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. Central to these ambitions is a belief that in order \\nfor all stakeholders to benefit, the company must grow stronger over the long term. Second, semiconductors will play a\\ncritical role in creating a better world and helping to reduce the impact on the environment. With our ambitions guiding our \\ndecision-making for the long term and our products helping to create a better world, we are confident that our collective\\nefforts will be impactful and long-lasting.\\nOur objective and strategy\\nAs engineers, we’re fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innovate to create a better world.\\nTechnology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and\\ngenerate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. Our strategy to maximize free cash per \\nshare growth has three elements: first, a great business model that’s focused on analog and embedded processing\\nproducts and built around four sustainable competitive advantages; second, discipline in allocating capital to the best \\nopportunities; lastly, a focus on efficiency, which means more output for every dollar spent. \\n2020 performance\\n2020 was possibly the most challenging year the world has collectively faced in a long time and highlighted the power of \\nour ambitions to guide our decisions and actions:\\n•\\nWe operated our factories to support our customers when their ability to forecast was minimal.\\n•\\nWe invested in our people and kept them safe.\\n•\\nWe invested in R&D, long-term manufacturing capacity and new capabilities.\\n•\\nWe invested in our communities in a year when the need was particularly high.\\nWhen 2020 was complete, TI was stronger, revenue grew slightly and the balance sheet remained strong. Additionally,\\nconsistent with our commitment to return free cash flow to owners, we increased our dividend 13%.\\nPerhaps most importantly, I couldn’t be prouder of how TIers adapted and performed in 2020. We have learned through \\nthe decades that challenging years are when our ambitions are most critical in guiding our decisions and when TIers rise to\\nthe challenge.\\nNote: Free cash ﬂow (non-GAAP) = Cash ﬂow from operations less capital expenditures.

Business \\nWe design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our operations \\nbegan in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we have design, manufacturing or \\nsales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report \\nthe results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2020, we generated $14.46 billion of revenue. \\nFor decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through \\nsemiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each \\ngeneration became more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors were used by a growing number of \\ncustomers and markets. This passion is alive today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications, \\nparticularly in industrial and automotive markets. \\nFor many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will \\nown the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a \\ncompany that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. When we are successful in \\nachieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win. \\nAs engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innovate to create a better world. \\nTechnology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and \\ngenerate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share.  \\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements:  \\nThe first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built \\naround four competitive advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made over the years and \\nthat continue today. The four sustainable competitive advantages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a \\nbroad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and diversity and longevity of \\nour products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitive advantages provide tangible benefits, are \\ndifficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in  \\na unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our \\ninvestments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. \\nThe second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans \\nhow we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think \\nabout acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Over a 10-year period from 2011 to 2020, we allocated $83 billion, which \\nreinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation over this period was to drive organic growth, \\nwhich includes investments in R&D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inventory. Beyond that, \\nwe also allocated capital to dividends and share repurchases. Dividends are designed to appeal to a broad set of investors, and \\nshare repurchases are made with the goal of the accretive capture of future free cash flow for long-term investors. Lastly, we \\nallocate to acquisitions for inorganic growth, which we last did in 2011 when we acquired National Semiconductor. \\nThe third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. \\nThis is about getting our investments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; \\nit is not just about optimizing cost-cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and \\ncontinuous improvement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to revenue growth, improved \\ngross margins, disciplined R&D and SG&A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth. \\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers \\nand will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation \\nand stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash \\nflow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.  \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 3 \\nProduct information \\nSemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. \\nSemiconductors, generally known as “chips,” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have         \\na diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, \\ninterfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal \\nresolution. This broad portfolio includes approximately 80,000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic \\nequipment. \\nOur segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development \\nrequirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how \\nmanagement allocates resources and measures results. \\nAnalog \\nOur Analog segment generated $10.89 billion of revenue in 2020. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as \\nsound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital \\ndata that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to \\nmanage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical \\nenergy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a \\ngrowing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human \\nbeings, the real world and other electronic devices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, \\nautomotive and personal electronics. \\nSales of our Analog products generated about 75% of our revenue in 2020.  \\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain. \\nPower \\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems in all end markets. Our broad portfolio is \\ndesigned to manage power requirements across different voltage levels, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC \\nswitching regulators, AC/DC and isolated controllers and converters, power switches, linear regulators, voltage supervisors, \\nvoltage references and lighting products. \\nSignal Chain \\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred       \\nor converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products, which serve a variety of end markets, include \\namplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks, logic and sensing products. \\nEmbedded Processing \\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $2.57 billion of revenue in 2020. Embedded Processing products are the digital \\n“brains” of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various \\ncombinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost \\nmicrocontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices such as motor \\ncontrol. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive. \\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and \\ndevelopment (R&D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our \\ncustomer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next. \\nSales of Embedded Processing products generated about 18% of our revenue in 2020.  \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 4 \\nOur Embedded Processing segment includes microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs) and applications processors. \\nMicrocontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of \\nspecific tasks for electronic equipment. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve \\ndigital data. Applications processors are designed for specific computing activity. \\nOther \\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other, which includes operating segments that do not meet the \\nquantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments.

As a result, we face \\nsignificant global competition from dozens of large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche \\nsuppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia. \\nWe believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the \\nbreadth of a company’s product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innovation, product \\ndevelopment execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and \\ncapabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance   \\nand a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products, and customers’ prior investments in software \\ndevelopment is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products. \\nMarket cycle \\nThe “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The \\nsemiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or \\ninsufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess \\nmanufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. A semiconductor \\ncycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing \\nfacilities. \\nWe employ several strategies which have many benefits, including dampening the effect of the semiconductor cycle on TI.     \\nAs an example, we are focused on building closer direct relationships with customers. When it comes to market cycles, these \\nrelationships provide improved insight into customer demand and allow us to more accurately and efficiently manage factory \\nloadings and inventory levels, which lead to more stable lead times and higher product availability. Finally, we focus our \\nresources on analog and embedded processing products and industrial and automotive markets. Generally, our products serve    \\na large and diverse customer base, which reduces our dependence on the performance of any single product, market or \\ncustomer. In addition, they typically have long shelf lives and low risk of obsolescence. Industrial and automotive markets   \\nalso benefit from long product life cycles, with revenue often lasting 10 years or more, which help to smooth the impact of \\ncyclicality. \\nSeasonality \\nOur revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the \\nfirst and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters. \\nCustomers, sales and distribution \\nWe sell our products to over 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than one-third of our revenue derived \\nfrom customers outside our largest 100. \\nWe market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and applications team, \\nand through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities and evolving our distribution \\nnetwork to better align with our strategy to establish closer direct relationships with our customers. With less business flowing \\nthrough the distribution channel, we require fewer distributors. During 2020, we completed our transition to a single worldwide \\ndistributor, coupled with a few region-specific distributors, for order fulfillment. Building closer direct customer relationships \\nstrengthens our reach of market channel advantage, which gives us access to more customers and more of their design projects, \\nleading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better \\ninsight and knowledge of customer needs. \\nOur investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce \\nenhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 6 \\nManufacturing \\nSemiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a \\nnumber of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process \\ntakes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments. \\nWe own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both \\nwafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities. \\nWe invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make \\nmanufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage delivers tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater \\ncontrol of our supply chain. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in \\nour advanced analog 300-millimeter capacity. An unpackaged chip built on 300-millimeter wafers costs about 40% less than   \\nan unpackaged chip built on 200-millimeter wafers. To strengthen this advantage, construction is underway on our new        \\n300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Richardson, Texas, as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority \\nof our Analog growth. \\nWe assess and are careful to address potential health, safety, and environmental risks presented by our operations, including our \\nmanufacturing operations. We care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate \\nchange by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials, controlling harmful emissions, and properly \\nhandling hazardous and restricted substances. \\nWe expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and \\nto obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our \\nmanufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we selectively use the capacity of outside \\nsuppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2020, we sourced about 20% of our total wafers from external \\nfoundries and about 40% of our assembly/test services from subcontractors. \\nInventory  \\nOur objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain stable and competitive lead times, \\nminimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater \\nflexibility in periods of high demand, we build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of \\napplications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and \\nseasonality. \\nRaw materials \\nWe purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source \\nsuppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such \\nmaterials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future. \\nIntellectual property \\nWe own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the United States and other countries in fields relating to \\nour business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also \\nhave license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not \\nconsider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 7 \\nExecutive officers of the Registrant \\nThe following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the executive officers of the company and the positions or offices \\nwith the company held by each person named: \\nName \\n Age  Position \\nAhmad S.

Risk factors \\nYou should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings \\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk \\nfactors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not \\nmeant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many \\ncompanies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our \\nperformance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to \\nfluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community’s \\nexpectations, changes in our and/or the investment community’s expectations for our future results, dividends or share \\nrepurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. \\nRisks related to our business and industry \\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial \\ncondition is uncertain. \\nThe global spread of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the \\ncoronavirus disease, COVID-19, has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both near-term and potentially \\nlong-term. We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,   \\nrelated third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the \\neconomic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which TI operates. The extent     \\nto which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operation and financial condition is difficult   \\nto predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social, \\nbusiness and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; and the effect of the pandemic on \\nshort- and long-term general economic conditions. We might experience short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility    \\nin customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results in future periods.�\\nOur global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or \\nother conditions. \\nWe have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 90% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the     \\nUnited States; shipments of products to China-based customers represent about 20% of our revenue. Certain countries where \\nwe operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic \\nconditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-\\nborder investment and other trade barriers. Trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into China, \\ncause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results.  \\nWe are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions  \\nand epidemics, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology \\nnetworks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. \\ndollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of     \\nnon-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. \\nWe face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. \\nWe face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect this competition will \\ncontinue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging \\ncompanies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. For example, we may face \\nincreased competition as a result of China actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through \\npolicy changes and investment. These actions, in conjunction with trade tensions, may restrict us from participating in the \\nChina market or may prevent us from competing effectively. Certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and \\nmanagement resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation \\namong our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. The price and product development pressures that result \\nfrom competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match \\nthe price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements    \\nof our competitors. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 9 \\nChanges in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. \\nOur customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. If demand in one or more \\nsectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The \\ncyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product \\ndemand. Additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including \\ncurtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of \\ncustomer or distributor inventory adjustments, changes in demand for customer products, or trade restrictions, may adversely \\naffect our results of operations and financial condition. \\nOur results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: \\nuncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events, epidemics or domestic or international \\npolitical, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer \\noperations; or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. \\nOur ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a \\nquarter’s revenue forecast. We manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands. These forecasts are based on \\nmultiple assumptions, and if inaccurate, could cause us to hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce    \\nour profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\nOur operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches, disruptions or other incidents \\nrelating to our information technology systems. \\nBreaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, \\nvendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, \\nunauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance, or human error. These events could, among other things, compromise \\nour information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our \\nsuppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the \\nrelease of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or \\npenalties, or claims for damages, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. Cybersecurity   \\nor other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties are \\nfrequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them. \\nOur ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes could affect our business plans \\nand results of operations. \\nFrom time to time, we undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and \\nrestructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives. If we do not successfully implement these changes, our business \\nplans and operating results could be adversely affected. We may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or \\nother benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and charges associated with these actions could differ \\nmaterially in amount and timing from our expectations. \\nOur results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. \\nWe have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as \\nsevere weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged \\ndisruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in the Properties section in  \\nItem 2, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. \\nRapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. \\nRapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average \\nselling prices of our products. Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture \\nand market innovative products in a timely and cost-effective manner. We make significant investments in research and \\ndevelopment to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and \\nimprove our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments \\nbecause they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially viable  \\nmay not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed.  \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 10 \\nWe face supply chain and manufacturing risks. \\nWe rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to needed goods \\nand services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers’ operations as a result \\nof, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or \\ninternational political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers \\noperate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources and utilities. Additionally, a breach or other \\nincident relating to our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary \\ninformation. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to \\nobtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. \\nIn particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural \\nresources and utilities be available. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results \\nof operations. Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. Our relationships \\nwith customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, \\nour costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as \\nconflict-free. \\nOur inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect \\nour results of operations. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we \\ndepend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. We do not have long-term \\ncontracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers involves risks, \\nincluding possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic \\nmanufacturing process technology in a timely, cost-effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers’ imposition  \\nof increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property.  \\nOur results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product \\nrecalls or legal proceedings. \\nClaims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, \\nmanufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims \\nor pay damage awards or settlements. In the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected \\ncustomer or end consumer. Any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. We maintain product \\nliability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. \\nIn addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a TI part, for example, with respect to products used in \\nautomotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Any     \\nof these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation. \\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a \\nloss with respect to our inventory. \\nWe have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. If a customer or \\ndistributor were to experience a loss with respect to TI-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition \\nwould be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or \\nif our recovery is delayed. \\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our \\ndistributors’ financial performance. \\nIn 2020, about half of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry \\ncompeting product lines, and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our \\nproducts. Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their \\ninability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 11 \\nOur margins vary. \\nOur profit margins vary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment volume; our \\nmanufacturing processes; product mix; inventory levels; tariffs; freight costs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes \\nin existing accounting practices or standards. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might \\nadversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our \\noperating costs is fixed. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, \\nand can adversely affect profit margins as a result. \\nOur continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees \\nin a competitive environment. \\nOur continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective \\nmanagement of succession for key employees. Skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, \\nmanagement, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There \\ncan be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical \\npersonnel that we require to execute our business strategy. Our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various \\nlocations may be limited by immigration laws. \\nLegal and regulatory risks \\nOur operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. \\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for \\nexample, the environment and climate change, safety and health; trade; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data \\nprivacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; epidemics; intellectual property ownership and \\ninfringement; and the movement of currency. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive \\nand could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. If we do not comply or if we \\nbecome subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should  \\nthese laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance \\ncosts or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business.  \\nSome of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health \\nrequirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and \\nregulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination      \\nof a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on \\nthe direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection \\nwith the manufacture of our products. A substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might    \\nnot be available at reasonable cost. \\nOur results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. \\nWe have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. \\nTax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. If our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be \\nadversely affected. A number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which  \\nour profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits or \\ndeductions, including for amounts relating to stock compensation; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations \\nor surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. We have deferred tax \\nassets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our \\nability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. \\nIn addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned    \\nand when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. These laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation. \\nChanges in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and \\nDevelopment’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn \\nincome, which could in turn affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast     \\nof our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax expense will change. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 12 \\nOur performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom \\nof operation. \\nAccess to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions \\nwhere we conduct business. There can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual \\nproperty rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct \\nour business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. To the extent that we have to rely \\non technology from others for which a license is required, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such a \\nlicense at all or on terms we consider reasonable. We, directly and indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, \\nincluding non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. We also \\nface infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may  \\nbe less established or less predictable. These assertions, whether or not of any merit, expose us to claims for damages and/or \\ninjunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual \\nor other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. \\nWe actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. However, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation \\nor improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties’ use of our patented or \\ncopyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties’ sale of counterfeit \\nproducts bearing our trademark. The risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. The laws    \\nof countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. \\nIncreases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\nFederal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, \\nwhich could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, obligations related     \\nto our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, \\nincluding the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension \\nregulations. Changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and \\nfunding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions. \\nRisks related to our financing activities and other risks \\nOur debt could affect our operations and financial condition. \\nFrom time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. While we believe we will have the ability \\nto service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which \\nwill be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, \\nincluding our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our obligation to make principal and \\ninterest payments could divert funds that otherwise might be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could \\ncause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. \\nOur results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. \\nWe maintain bank accounts, one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the \\nfinancing needs of the company. Our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service \\nour debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, \\nand may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity \\nthrough short-term bank loans. If we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the \\nfinancial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the \\ncapital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted.  \\nMaterial impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. \\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet.

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations \\nOverview \\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the \\nfoundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value \\nfor owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. \\nOur strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements: \\n1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable \\ncompetitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide \\ntangible benefits: \\ni. \\nA strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our \\nsupply chain. \\nii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and \\nmore value for our investments. \\niii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, \\nleading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and \\nknowledge of customer needs. \\niv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point \\ndependency and longer returns on our investments.  \\nTogether, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and \\nreturning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term \\nstrengthening and leveraging of these advantages. \\n2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new \\ncapabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash \\nto our owners. \\n3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. \\nWe believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers \\nand will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation \\nand stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash \\nflow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.  \\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction \\nwith the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our \\nresults of operations: \\n• \\nOur segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development \\nrequirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management \\nallocates resources and measures results. During 2020, we reorganized the product lines within our Analog segment   \\nto simplify our business structure into our Power and Signal Chain product lines. These changes had no impact on our \\npreviously reported consolidated financial statements or on our reportable segment results. See Note 1 to the financial \\nstatements for more information regarding our segments. \\n• \\nWhen we discuss our results: \\n� \\nUnless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are \\nevidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. \\n� \\nNew products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell \\nsuch a large number of products. \\n� \\nFrom time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or \\nlower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 17 \\n� \\nBecause we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is \\nfixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other \\ncircumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are \\nspread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and \\ndecreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand. \\n• \\nFor an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial \\ninformation section. \\n• \\nAll dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. \\nOur results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2020 and 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between \\n2020 and 2019. Discussion of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this \\nForm 10-K can be found in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in Part II, \\nItem 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.  \\nImpact of COVID-19 \\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its follow-on effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact business \\nactivity across industries worldwide, including TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for   \\nthe next few years. \\nThe impact to our lead times and ability to fulfill orders was minimal in 2020. However, depending on pandemic-related factors \\nlike the potential of local manufacturing restrictions on our factories, we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer \\norders in future periods. The coronavirus pandemic remains dynamic with uncertainty around its duration and broader impact. \\nWe continue to monitor and assess the situation and address implications to our business, supply chain and customer demand. \\nWe have long had a business continuity plan in place for unforeseeable situations, like we have seen with COVID-19. \\nAdditionally, over the past several years, we have invested in building inventory and expanding our global internally owned \\nmanufacturing footprint. Investing in these capabilities has given us flexibility, such as the ability to build products across \\nmultiple manufacturing sites. These investments have helped to minimize disruptions, but may not be sufficient to eliminate \\nthem. \\nResults of operations \\nOur strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal \\nelectronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we \\nplace additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which \\nwe believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 64.1% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as  \\nwell as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production.�\\nOur focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from \\noperations of $6.14 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $5.49 billion and represented \\n38.0% of revenue. During 2020, consistent with our commitment to return free cash flow to owners, we returned $5.98 billion \\nto shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, \\nunderscoring its sustainability.  \\nDetails of financial results – 2020 compared with 2019 \\nRevenue of $14.46 billion increased $78 million, or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue from Analog, partially offset by lower \\nrevenue from Embedded Processing. \\nGross profit of $9.27 billion was up $105 million, or 1%, due to higher revenue and increased factory loadings. As a percentage \\nof revenue, gross profit increased to 64.1% from 63.7%. \\nOperating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.15 billion compared with $3.19 billion. \\nAcquisition charges were $198 million compared with $288 million and were non-cash. See Note 7 to the financial statements. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 18 \\nRestructuring charges/other was a charge of $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action, compared with a credit of \\n$36 million due to the sale of our manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland in 2019. \\nOperating profit was $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue, compared with $5.72 billion, or 39.8% of revenue. \\nOther income and expense (OI&E) was $313 million of income compared with $175 million of income, which increased \\nprimarily due to higher royalty income. See Note 12 to the financial statements. \\nInterest and debt expense of $190 million increased $20 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. \\nOur provision for income taxes was $422 million compared with $711 million. The decrease was due to higher discrete tax \\nbenefits, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position and, to a \\nlesser extent, higher U.S. tax benefits, partially offset by higher income before income taxes.  \\nOur annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, was 14% compared with 16% in 2019. We use “annual \\noperating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, \\nwas 7% in 2020 compared with 12% in 2019. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory \\ncorporate tax rate to our effective tax rate. \\nNet income was $5.60 billion compared with $5.02 billion.

Days of inventory at the end of 2020 were 123 \\ncompared with 144 at the end of 2019. �\\nLiquidity and capital resources \\nOur primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, \\nshort-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2020 were \\n$6.14 billion, a decrease of $510 million primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital, partially offset by  \\nhigher net income. \\nOur revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until \\nMarch 2024. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2020, our \\ncredit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. \\nInvesting activities for 2020 used $922 million compared with $1.92 billion in 2019. Capital expenditures were $649 million \\ncompared with $847 million in 2019 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both \\nperiods. Short-term investments used cash of $241 million in 2020 compared with $1.14 billion in 2019. \\nFinancing activities for 2020 used $4.55 billion compared with $4.73 billion in 2019. In 2020, we received net proceeds of \\n$1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. In 2019, we received \\nnet proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $750 million. \\nDividends paid in 2020 were $3.43 billion compared with $3.01 billion in 2019, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, \\npartially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $2.55 billion to repurchase 23.4 million shares of our common stock \\ncompared with $2.96 billion used in 2019 to repurchase 27.4 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided  \\ncash proceeds of $470 million compared with $539 million in 2019. \\nWe had $3.11 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $3.46 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. We \\nbelieve we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, \\ndividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. \\nNon-GAAP financial information \\nThis MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not \\nprepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).

As disclosed in Note 2,   \\nthe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates \\nand assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. \\nHowever, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is \\nunlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider \\nthe following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that   \\nrequire a higher degree of judgment. \\nIncome taxes \\nIn determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation  \\nof tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary \\ndifferences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.  \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 21 \\nIn the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is \\nuncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex \\ntax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more \\nlikely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential \\nliabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate \\nresolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, \\nno assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical \\nincome tax provisions and accruals. \\nAs part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not \\nlikely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred   \\ntax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax \\nassets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions \\nand their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the \\ndeferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made. \\nInventory valuation allowances \\nInventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Statistical \\nallowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for \\nsalability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory \\nlevels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory \\nconsidered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not \\ncaptured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are \\nalso calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value \\nfor those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and \\ncalculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology \\nshifts and other factors. \\nChanges in accounting standards \\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding the status of new accounting and reporting standards. \\nOff-balance sheet arrangements \\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC \\nRegulation S-K. \\nCommitments and contingencies \\nSee Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 22 \\nITEM 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk \\nForeign exchange risk \\nThe U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in \\nU.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently \\nimpact our effective tax rate. \\nOur balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. \\ndollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2020 balances \\nand currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the \\nU.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately $3 million. \\nWe use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on \\nour non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2020, we had forward currency exchange contracts \\noutstanding with a notional value of $416 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $147 million to sell Japanese \\nyen, $85 million to sell euros and $82 million to sell British pounds). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2019. \\nInterest rate risk \\nWe have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value \\nof our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of \\nchanges in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. \\nAs of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our \\ninvestments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $9 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term \\ndebt by $650 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash \\nflows associated with long-term debt. \\nEquity risk \\nLong-term investments at year-end 2020 include the following: \\n• \\nInvestments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in \\ncertain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity \\ninvestments. \\n• \\nInvestments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the \\nequity method or at cost as non-marketable equity securities). \\n• \\nEquity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. \\nInvestments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset \\nrelated changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds \\nare stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. \\nInvestments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 6 to the financial statements  \\nfor details of equity and other long-term investments. \\nWe also utilize total return swaps to economically hedge exposure to changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of \\ncertain deferred compensation arrangements with employees. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these total  \\nreturn swaps generally offset the related losses or gains on the deferred compensation liabilities. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 23 \\nITEM 8.

statements \\n1. Description of business, including segment and geographic area information \\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two \\nreportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined \\non the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution \\nchannels. \\n• \\nAnalog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning \\nthem, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other \\nsemiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all  \\nelectronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, \\nwhether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product \\nlines: Power and Signal Chain. \\n• \\nEmbedded Processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to \\nhandle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on  \\nthe application. \\nDuring 2020, we reorganized the product lines within our Analog segment to simplify our business structure into our Power and \\nSignal Chain product lines. These changes had no effect on either our previously reported consolidated financial statements or \\nour reportable segment results. \\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the \\nquantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other \\nincludes DLP® products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. \\nExamples of these items include acquisition charges (see Note 7); restructuring charges (see Note 12); and certain corporate-\\nlevel items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, \\nincluding asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating \\nsegments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount. \\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our \\noperating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the \\nsegments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the \\nsegments’ results and, therefore, is not provided. \\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating \\ndecision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The \\naccounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and \\npractices. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 30 \\nSegment information \\n \\nFor Years Ended December 31, \\n \\n2020 \\n \\n2019 \\n \\n2018 \\nRevenue: \\n \\n  \\n  \\nAnalog ............................................................................................................................  $ 10,886   $ 10,223   $ 10,801   \\nEmbedded Processing .....................................................................................................  \\n2,570   \\n2,943   \\n3,554  \\nOther ...............................................................................................................................  \\n1,005   \\n1,217   \\n1,429  \\nTotal revenue .....................................................................................................................  $ 14,461   $ 14,383   $ 15,784   \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\nOperating profit: \\n \\n  \\n  \\nAnalog ............................................................................................................................  $ 4,912   $ 4,477   $ 5,109   \\nEmbedded Processing .....................................................................................................  \\n743   \\n907   \\n1,205  \\nOther ...............................................................................................................................  \\n239   \\n339   \\n399  \\nTotal operating profit .........................................................................................................  $ 5,894   $ 5,723   $ 6,713   \\nGeographic area information \\nThe following geographic area information includes revenue, based on product shipment destination, and property, plant and \\nequipment, based on physical location.

Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices \\nBasis of presentation \\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the \\nUnited States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein. \\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have \\nbeen eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share \\namounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior \\nperiods’ financial statements to conform to the 2020 presentation. \\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary. \\nSignificant accounting policies and practices \\nRevenue recognition \\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. We \\nhave a variety of types of contracts with our customers and distributors. In determining whether a contract exists, we evaluate \\nthe terms of the arrangement, the relationship with the customer or distributor and their ability to pay. \\nWe recognize revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, when control is transferred. Control is \\nconsidered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required,   \\nwhen the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to    \\nthe customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is \\ngenerally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the \\nproducts. \\nRevenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time,  \\nwhen the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and \\ntransfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to \\npay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we  \\nretain control over the products’ disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products. \\nThe revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount \\nmethodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally \\ninclude adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns and incentives. The length of time between invoicing and \\npayment is not significant under any of our payment terms. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from \\nthe timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. \\nIn addition, we record an allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor \\ncollectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we \\nassess the impact on amounts recorded for credit losses and, if necessary, record a charge in the period such determination is \\nmade. \\nWe recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in \\ncost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties. \\nAdvertising costs \\nWe expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $28 million, $30 million and $34 million    \\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \\nIncome taxes \\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the \\ncurrent year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized  \\nin the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of  \\nthe deferred tax assets will not be realized. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 32 \\nOther assessed taxes \\nSome transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions \\nare presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis. \\nLeases \\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are included in other long-term assets, accrued expenses and \\nother liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \\nLease assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligations to \\nmake lease payments over the lease term. On the commencement date, leases are evaluated for classification, and assets and \\nliabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing \\nrate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments. Operating lease \\nexpense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease values include options to extend or not to \\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. \\nWe have agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Leases with \\nan initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on  \\na straight-line basis over the lease term. \\nEarnings per share (EPS) \\nWe use the two-class method for calculating EPS because the restricted stock units (RSUs) we grant are participating securities \\ncontaining non-forfeitable rights to receive dividend equivalents. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is \\nallocated to RSUs and excluded from the calculation of income allocated to common stock. \\nComputation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows (shares in millions): \\n \\nFor Years Ended December 31, \\n \\n2020 \\n \\n \\n   2019 \\n \\n \\n \\n2018 \\n \\n \\nNet \\nIncome    Shares       EPS  \\nNet \\nIncome    Shares       EPS  \\nNet \\nIncome    Shares       EPS \\nBasic EPS: \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\nNet income .......................................... $ 5,595    \\n  \\n \\n$ 5,017     \\n  \\n \\n$ 5,580     \\n  \\nIncome allocated to RSUs ...................\\n(27)   \\n  \\n \\n(32)    \\n  \\n \\n(43)    \\n  \\nIncome allocated to common stock ..... $ 5,568        921   $ 6.05    $ 4,985    \\n936   $ 5.33    $ 5,537    \\n970   $ 5.71   \\nDilutive effect of stock    \\ncompensation plans ............................. \\n       12    \\n  \\n      16      \\n \\n \\n      20      \\nDiluted EPS: \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\nNet income .......................................... $ 5,595    \\n  \\n \\n$ 5,017     \\n  \\n \\n$ 5,580     \\n  \\nIncome allocated to RSUs ...................\\n(27)   \\n  \\n \\n(31)    \\n  \\n \\n(42)    \\n  \\nIncome allocated to common stock ..... $ 5,568       933   $ 5.97    $ 4,986    \\n952   $ 5.24    $ 5,538    \\n 990   $ 5.59   \\nPotentially dilutive securities representing 4 million, 6 million and 4 million shares of common stock that were outstanding in \\n2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these \\nperiods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  \\nInvestments \\nWe present investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term \\ninvestments, which are detailed below. See Note 6 for additional information. \\n• \\nCash equivalents and short-term investments – We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with \\nmaturities of 90 days or less from the date of our investment to be cash equivalents. We consider investments in \\navailable-for-sale debt securities with maturities beyond 90 days from the date of our investment as being available for \\nuse in current operations and include them in short-term investments. The primary objectives of our cash equivalent \\nand short-term investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 33 \\n• \\nLong-term investments – Long-term investments consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable \\nequity securities. \\nInventories \\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted \\nstandard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of \\ninstalled factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at \\nconsignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory. \\nWe review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered \\nunlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity, historical customer \\nshipments, as well as estimated future sales. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant \\nevent not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs. \\nProperty, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles; and other capitalized costs \\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. \\nOur cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date \\nof acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease \\nterm or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over \\nthe estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the \\nterm of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization. \\nImpairments of long-lived assets \\nWe regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or \\nother long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the \\nprojected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge \\nis based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market \\nvaluations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows. \\nGoodwill \\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform our annual \\ngoodwill impairment test as of October 1 for our reporting units, which compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its \\nassociated carrying value, including goodwill. See Note 7 for additional information. \\nForeign currency \\nThe functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. \\ndollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred taxes, other assets, current \\nliabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant \\nand equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense \\naccounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange \\ngains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&E. \\nDerivatives and hedging \\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward \\nforeign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate \\nfluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of \\nthese forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our \\nforeign currency derivative instruments. \\nWe are exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. We \\nuse total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense, recognizing changes  \\nin the value of the swaps and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. \\nIn connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that \\nare recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions have not \\nbeen material. \\nWe do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 34 \\nChanges in accounting standards – adopted standards for current period \\nWe adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) during the current period, none of which had a material impact \\non our financial position or results of operations. \\n             ASU \\n \\nDescription \\n \\n     Adopted Date \\nASU No. 2016-13 \\n \\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of              \\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments \\n \\n     January 1, 2020 \\nASU No. 2018-13 \\n \\nFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes       \\nto the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement \\n \\n     January 1, 2020 \\nASU No. 2018-15 \\n \\nIntangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software                             \\n(Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs             \\nIncurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract \\n \\n     January 1, 2020 \\n \\n3. Stock compensation \\nWe have stock options outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. The option price per share may not be less \\nthan the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The options have a 10-year term, generally vest ratably \\nover four years and continue to vest after the option recipient retires. \\nWe also have RSUs outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. Each RSU represents the right to receive one \\nshare of TI common stock, issued on the vesting date, which is generally four years after the date of grant. RSUs continue to \\nvest after the recipient retires. Holders of RSUs receive an annual cash payment equivalent to the dividends paid on our \\ncommon stock. \\nWe have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under director compensation plans. The plans generally \\nprovide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the \\nissuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to director deferred compensation accounts. \\nWe also have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts \\nbased on a percentage of the employee’s compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is 85% of \\nthe fair market value on the exercise date. \\nTotal stock compensation expense recognized is as follows: \\n \\n       For Years Ended December 31, \\n \\n   2020 \\n    2019 \\n    2018 \\nCOR ......................................................................................................................................  \\n$     21  \\n  $     21  \\n  $     25  \\n \\nR&D .....................................................................................................................................  \\n      68  \\n        66  \\n        69  \\n \\nSG&A ...................................................................................................................................  \\n    135  \\n      130  \\n      138  \\n \\nTotal ......................................................................................................................................  \\n$   224  \\n  $   217  \\n  $   232  \\n \\nThese amounts include expenses related to non-qualified stock options, RSUs and stock options offered under our ESPP and are \\nnet of estimated forfeitures. \\nWe recognize compensation expense for non-qualified stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the minimum \\nservice period required for vesting of the award, adjusting for estimated forfeitures based on historical activity.

We estimate the fair values for \\nnon-qualified stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average \\nassumptions: \\n \\nFor Years Ended December 31, \\n \\n     2020 \\n      2019 \\n       2018 \\nWeighted average grant date fair value, per share ..........................................................  $ 25.55  \\n  $ 22.08  \\n   $ 23.20   \\nWeighted average assumptions used: \\n \\n  \\n  \\nExpected volatility .....................................................................................................         26% \\n       26%           23%  \\nExpected lives (in years) ............................................................................................        6.8  \\n       7.1 \\n         7.2 \\nRisk-free interest rates ................................................................................................      1.53%      2.66%         2.57%  \\nExpected dividend yields ...........................................................................................      2.76%      2.95%         2.25%  \\nWe determine expected volatility on all options granted using available implied volatility rates. We believe that market-based \\nmeasures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of the expected volatility used in these estimates. \\nWe determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our optionees using a rolling     \\n10-year average. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available. \\nRisk-free interest rates are determined using the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with \\na remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. \\nExpected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our \\ncommon stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved  \\nplan to change the dividend in the near term. \\nThe fair value per share of RSUs is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. \\nOur ESPP is a discount-purchase plan and consequently the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model is not used to \\ndetermine the fair value per share of these awards. The fair value per share under this plan equals the amount of the discount. \\nLong-term incentive and director compensation plans \\nStock option and RSU transactions under our long-term incentive and director compensation plans are as follows: \\n \\nStock Options \\n \\nRSUs \\n \\nShares \\nWeighted Average    \\nExercise Price  \\nper Share \\n \\nShares \\n \\nWeighted Average \\nGrant Date Fair \\nValue per Share \\nOutstanding grants, December 31, 2019......................  \\n32,493,944           $  66.57  \\n     5,897,800           $  79.62  \\n \\nGranted ......................................................................  \\n4,253,606             130.48  \\n     1,005,778             130.59  \\n \\nStock options exercised/RSUs vested .......................  \\n(8,392,354)              53.28  \\n  (2,034,933)              53.88  \\n \\nForfeited and expired ................................................  \\n(359,919)            111.06  \\n  \\n(157,021)            103.90  \\n \\nOutstanding grants, December 31, 2020 ..................  \\n 27,995,277            79.69 \\n     4,711,624             100.80  \\n \\nThe weighted average grant date fair values per share of RSUs granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $130.59, $106.58 and \\n$110.05, respectively.

The procedures for relief from double taxation pertain to U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2007 through 2012. \\nIn non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations.

Our postretirement plan assets are carried at fair value or net asset value per \\nshare. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, \\napproximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of long-term \\ndebt, including the current portion, was $6.80 billion, and the estimated fair value was $7.78 billion. The estimated fair value   \\nis measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 6 for a description of fair value and the definition  \\nof Level 2 inputs. \\nRisk concentration \\nWe are subject to counterparty risks from financial institutions, customers and issuers of debt securities. Financial instruments \\nthat could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments and \\naccounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and \\nlimit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative \\ncontracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 41 \\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their \\ndispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, \\nincentives and credit losses. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \\nAccounts receivable allowances changed to reflect amounts charged (credited) to operating results by $3 million, ($11) million \\nand $11 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \\nMajor customer \\nOne of our end customers accounted for 10%, 8% and 8% of revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, recognized \\nprimarily in our Analog segment. No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2019 or 2018.  \\n6. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities \\nInvestments measured at fair value \\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments, money market funds and mutual funds are stated at fair value, which is generally based on \\nmarket prices or broker quotes. See Fair-value considerations. Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale debt \\nsecurities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any credit \\nlosses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in OI&E in \\nour Consolidated Statements of Income. \\nOur mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain \\ndeferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred \\ncompensation liabilities in SG&A. \\nOther investments \\nOur other investments include equity-method investments and non-marketable equity investments, which are not measured at \\nfair value.

We did not recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments in 2020, 2019 or 2018. All of our debt \\nsecurities classified as available for sale as of December 31, 2020, have maturities within one year. \\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were \\n$5.29 billion, $2.31 billion and $6.71 billion, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. \\nIn 2020, we entered into total return swaps to economically hedge the variability of certain deferred compensation obligations \\nto employees. As a result, we received proceeds of $253 million from the sale of investments in mutual funds that were \\npreviously being utilized to offset this exposure. \\nFair-value considerations \\nWe measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price \\nthat would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market \\nfor the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. \\nThe three-level hierarchy described below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements. \\n• \\nLevel 1 – Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the \\nreporting date. \\n• \\nLevel 2 – Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date \\nthrough correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and \\nquoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or \\nother pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, \\nsuch as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data \\nservice to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes \\nobtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets. \\n• \\nLevel 3 – Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant \\nmanagement judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates \\nof market participant assumptions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no Level 3 assets or liabilities. \\nThe following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.

Postretirement benefit plans \\nPlan descriptions \\nWe have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit \\nplans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements. \\nU.S. retirement plans \\nOur principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and \\nqualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, \\nand then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease \\naccruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. \\nBoth defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax \\ncontributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined \\nbenefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are \\nprovided for up to 2% of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in \\nthe defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate \\nin the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee’s  \\nannual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4% of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. \\nEmployees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2% of the employee’s annual \\neligible earnings. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 44 \\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI \\ncommon stock totaling 7 million shares and 8 million shares valued at $1.12 billion and $988 million, respectively. Dividends \\npaid on these shares in 2020 and 2019 were $27 million and $26 million, respectively. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common \\nstock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund. \\nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $61 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018. \\nThe defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no \\nlonger accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under  \\nthe qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of service and the highest five \\nconsecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements   \\nof applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined \\nbenefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants. \\nU.S. retiree health care benefit plan \\nU.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution \\ntoward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon \\nvarious factors, the most important of which are an employee’s date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility \\nfor Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan’s participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are \\nresponsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement. \\nNon-U.S. retirement plans \\nWe provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, \\nthrough a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee’s \\nyears of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are \\nsubject to local country practices and market circumstances. \\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI \\ncommon stock valued at $36 million and $28 million, respectively.

Our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan \\nassets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed \\nasset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset \\ngrowth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities \\nwith return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. \\nAssumptions and investment policies \\n \\nU.S. Defined  \\nBenefit \\n \\nU.S. Retiree  \\nHealth Care \\n \\nNon-U.S.  \\nDefined Benefit \\n \\n2020  \\n2019  \\n2020  \\n2019  \\n2020  \\n2019 \\nWeighted average assumptions used                                     \\nto determine benefit obligations: \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nDiscount rate ......................................................................... 2.81%  \\n3.62%  \\n2.74%  \\n3.63%  \\n1.31%  \\n1.46% \\nLong-term pay progression ................................................... 3.70%  \\n3.30%  \\nn/a \\n \\nn/a \\n \\n3.15%  \\n3.06% \\nWeighted average assumptions used                                     \\nto determine net periodic benefit cost: \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\nDiscount rate ......................................................................... 3.42%  \\n4.35%  \\n3.63%  \\n4.30%  \\n1.46%  \\n1.85% \\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets ................................ 4.00%  \\n4.90%  \\n3.50%  \\n4.40%  \\n2.93%  \\n3.62% \\nLong-term pay progression ................................................... 3.30%  \\n3.30%  \\nn/a \\n \\nn/a \\n \\n3.06%  \\n3.03% \\nWe utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in \\nthe country in which the benefit plan operates. In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds \\nis selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide \\ncash flows sufficient to pay the plan’s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of \\nreturn of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality \\nbonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield \\ncurve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a \\npresent value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For \\ncountries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index is used to establish the discount rate. \\nAssumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset \\nclass and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses \\nof the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of \\nthe plans’ investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments \\nwithin the various countries. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 48 \\nThe target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets are as follows: \\n \\nU.S. Defined  \\nBenefit \\n \\nU.S. Retiree  \\nHealth Care \\n \\nNon-U.S.  \\nDefined Benefit \\nFixed income securities and cash equivalents .......................................\\n65% – 80% \\n \\n65% – 80% \\n \\n60% – 100% \\nEquity securities ....................................................................................\\n20% – 35% \\n \\n20% – 35% \\n \\n0% – 40% \\nWe rebalance the plans’ investments when they are outside the target allocation ranges. \\nWeighted average asset allocations as of December 31 are as follows: \\n \\nU.S. Defined  \\nBenefit \\n \\nU.S. Retiree  \\nHealth Care \\n \\nNon-U.S.  \\nDefined Benefit \\n \\n2020  \\n2019  \\n2020  \\n2019  \\n2020  \\n2019 \\nFixed income securities and cash equivalents .......................................\\n70%  \\n65%  \\n65%  \\n65%  \\n76%  \\n73% \\nEquity securities ....................................................................................\\n30%  \\n35%  \\n35%  \\n35%  \\n24%  \\n27% \\nNone of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in \\nTI common stock. \\nThe following assumed future benefit payments to plan participants in the next 10 years are used to measure our benefit \\nobligations.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material \\nrespects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash \\nflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted \\naccounting principles. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \\n(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in \\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission \\n(2013 framework) and our report dated February 5, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \\nBasis for opinion \\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \\nthe Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are \\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable \\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform  \\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due \\nto error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included \\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nCritical audit matter \\nThe critical audit matter communicated is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are \\nmaterial to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The \\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements,   \\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical \\naudit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 55 \\nUncertain tax positions \\nDescription of the \\nmatter \\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the  \\nUnited States and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and its income tax returns are subject to \\nexamination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these \\nreturns. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The \\nCompany uses significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax \\nposition is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that \\nqualifies for recognition. Auditing management’s estimate of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies \\nfor recognition involved auditor judgment because management’s estimate is complex, requires a \\nhigh degree of judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. \\nHow we addressed the \\nmatter in our audit \\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of \\ncontrols over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. For example, this \\nincluded controls over the Company’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and \\nmanagement’s process to measure the benefit of those tax positions. Among other procedures \\nperformed, we involved our tax professionals to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax \\npositions. This included assessing the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities \\nand evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the Company. We also \\nevaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting for its tax positions taking into \\nconsideration relevant international and local income tax laws and legal rulings. We analyzed the \\nCompany’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize and \\ntested the accuracy of the calculations. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s financial \\nstatement disclosures in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements related to these tax matters. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1952. \\nDallas, Texas \\nFebruary 5, 2021 \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 56 \\nITEM 9. Changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure \\nNot applicable. \\nITEM 9A. Controls and procedures \\nDisclosure controls and procedures \\nAn evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation \\nof management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and \\noperation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities  \\nExchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that \\nthose disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  \\nInternal control over financial reporting \\nReport by management on internal control over financial reporting \\nThe management of TI is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. TI’s \\ninternal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the \\npreparation and fair presentation of financial statements issued for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted \\naccounting principles. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) \\nand 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020 that has materially \\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect \\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may \\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate. \\nTI management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this \\nassessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 \\nframework) (the COSO criteria) in Internal Control � Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of \\nDecember 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. \\nTI’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our \\ninternal control over financial reporting, which immediately follows this report. \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 57 \\nReport of independent registered public accounting firm \\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Instruments Incorporated \\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting \\nWe have audited Texas Instruments Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on \\ncriteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \\nTreadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Texas Instruments Incorporated (the Company) \\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the \\nCOSO criteria. \\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated \\nstatements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period \\nended December 31, 2020, and the related notes, and our report dated February 5, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion \\nthereon. \\nBasis for opinion \\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its \\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report by management \\non internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over \\nfinancial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and \\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all \\nmaterial respects. \\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material \\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,  \\nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a \\nreasonable basis for our opinion. \\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting \\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to  \\npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDallas, Texas \\nFebruary 5, 2021 \\n', ' \\n2020 FORM 10-K � PAGE 58 \\nITEM 9B.

The board does not follow any ratio or formula     \\nto determine the appropriate mix. Rather, it uses its judgment to identify nominees whose backgrounds, attributes and \\nexperiences, taken as a whole, will contribute to the high standards of board service at the company. The board actively seeks \\nwomen and minority candidates for the pool from which board candidates are chosen. Maintaining a balance of tenure among \\nthe directors is also part of the board’s consideration. Longer-serving directors bring valuable experience with the company  \\nand familiarity with the strategic and operational challenges it has faced over the years, while newer directors bring fresh \\nperspectives and ideas. To help maintain this balance, the company has a mandatory retirement policy, pursuant to which \\ndirectors cannot stand for election after reaching age 70. The effectiveness of the board’s approach to board composition \\ndecisions is evidenced by the directors’ participation in the insightful and robust, yet respectful, deliberation that occurs at \\nboard and committee meetings, and in shaping the agendas for those meetings.  \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 6 \\nNominee criteria \\nIn evaluating prospective nominees and as stated in our corporate governance guidelines, the Governance and Stockholder \\nRelations (GSR) Committee considers the following criteria: \\n• \\nOutstanding achievement in the individual’s personal career. \\n• \\nRelevant commercial expertise. \\n• \\nInternational operations experience. \\n• \\nFinancial acumen. \\n• \\nGovernment experience. \\n• \\nStandards of integrity and soundness of judgment. \\n• \\nAbility to make independent, analytical inquiries. \\n• \\nAbility to represent the total corporate interests of TI (a director will not be selected to, nor be expected to, represent \\nthe interests of any particular group). \\n• \\nBoard diversity (viewpoints, gender, ethnicity). \\n• \\nWillingness and ability to devote the time required to perform board activities adequately. Directors should not serve \\non the boards of more than four other public companies. \\nNominee assessment  \\nAs it considered director nominees for the 2021 annual meeting, the board kept in mind that the most important issues it \\nconsiders typically relate to the company’s strategic direction; succession planning for senior executive positions; the \\ncompany’s financial performance; the challenges of running a large, complex enterprise, including the management of its risks; \\nmajor acquisitions and divestitures; and significant research and development (R&D) and capital investment decisions. These \\nissues arise in the context of the company’s operations, which primarily involve the manufacture and sale of semiconductors all \\nover the world into industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment and enterprise systems markets. \\nAs described below, each of our director nominees has achieved an extremely high level of success in his or her career, whether \\nat multibillion dollar, multinational corporate enterprises or significant governmental organizations. In these positions, each has \\nbeen directly involved in the challenges relating to setting the strategic direction and managing the financial performance, \\npersonnel and processes of large, complex organizations. Each has had exposure to effective leaders and has developed the \\nability to judge leadership qualities. Ten of the director nominees have experience in serving on the board of directors of at \\nleast one other major corporation, and one has served in high political office, all of which provides additional relevant \\nexperience on which each nominee can draw. \\nIn concluding that each nominee should serve as a director, the board relied on the specific experiences and attributes listed \\nbelow and on the direct personal knowledge, born of previous service on the board, that each of the nominees brings insight to \\nboard deliberations as well as a willingness to ask challenging questions. \\nAll nominees for directorship are currently directors. The board believes its current size is within the desired range as stated in \\nthe board’s corporate governance guidelines. \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 7 \\nDirector nominees \\n \\nMark Blinn \\nFormer chief executive officer of Flowserve Corporation \\n \\nCareer highlights \\nMr. Blinn served in various positions at \\nFlowserve, including as chief executive \\nofficer and president from 2009 to 2017 \\nand chief financial officer from 2004 to \\n2009.

Attendance allows for direct \\ninteraction between stockholders and board members. In 2020, all directors attended TI’s annual meeting of stockholders. \\nDirector independence \\nThe board has determined that each of our directors is independent except for Mr. Templeton. In connection with this \\ndetermination, information was reviewed regarding directors’ business and charitable affiliations, directors’ immediate family \\nmembers and their employers, and any transactions or arrangements between the company and such persons or entities. The \\nboard has adopted the following standards for determining independence. \\nA. In no event will a director be considered independent if:  \\n1. \\nHe or she is a current partner of or is employed by the company’s independent auditors; \\n2. \\nA family member of the director is (a) a current partner of the company’s independent auditors or (b) currently \\nemployed by the company’s independent auditors and personally works on the company’s audit; \\n3. \\nWithin the current or preceding three fiscal years he or she was, and remains at the time of the determination, a \\npartner in or a controlling shareholder, an executive officer or an employee of an organization that in the current \\nyear or any of the past three fiscal years (a) made payments to, or received payments from, the company for \\nproperty or services, (b) extended loans to or received loans from, the company, or (c) received charitable \\ncontributions from the company, in an amount or amounts which, in the aggregate in such fiscal year, exceeded \\nthe greater of $200,000 or 2% of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenues for that year (for purposes of this \\nstandard, “payments” excludes payments arising solely from investments in the company’s securities and \\npayments under non-discretionary charitable contribution matching programs); or \\n4. \\nWithin the current or preceding three fiscal years a family member of the director was, and remains at the time of \\nthe determination, a partner in or a controlling shareholder or an executive officer of an organization that in the \\ncurrent year or any of the past three fiscal years (a) made payments to, or received payments from, the company \\nfor property or services, (b) extended loans to or received loans from the company, or (c) received charitable \\ncontributions from the company, in an amount or amounts which, in the aggregate in such fiscal year, exceeded \\nthe greater of $200,000 or 2% of the recipient’s consolidated gross revenues for that year (for purposes of this \\nstandard, “payments” excludes payments arising solely from investments in the company’s securities and \\npayments under non-discretionary charitable contribution matching programs). \\nB. In no event will a director be considered independent if, within the preceding three years: \\n1. \\nHe or she was employed by the company (except in the capacity of interim chairman of the board, chief executive \\nofficer or other executive officer, provided the interim employment did not last longer than one year); \\n2. \\nHe or she received more than $120,000 during any twelve-month period in compensation from the company \\n(other than (a) compensation for board or board committee service, (b) compensation received for former service \\nlasting no longer than one year as an interim chairman of the board, chief executive officer or other executive \\nofficer and (c) benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan, or non-discretionary compensation); \\n3. \\nA family member of the director was employed as an executive officer by the company; \\n4. \\nA family member of the director received more than $120,000 during any twelve-month period in compensation \\nfrom the company (excluding compensation as a non-executive officer employee of the company); \\n5. \\nHe or she was (but is no longer) a partner or employee of the company’s independent auditors and worked on the \\ncompany’s audit within that time; \\n6. \\nA family member of the director was (but is no longer) a partner or employee of the company’s independent \\nauditors and worked on the company’s audit within that time; \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 12 \\n7. \\nHe or she was an executive officer of another entity at which any of the company’s current executive officers at \\nany time during the past three years served on that entity’s compensation committee; or \\n8. \\nA family member of the director was an executive officer of another entity at which any of the company’s current \\nexecutive officers at any time during the past three years served on that entity’s compensation committee. \\nC. No member of the Audit Committee may accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory \\nfee from the company, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the board or any board committee. \\nCompensatory fees do not include the receipt of fixed amounts of compensation under a retirement plan (including \\ndeferred compensation) for prior service with the company (provided that such compensation is not contingent in any \\nway on continued service). In addition, no member of the Audit Committee may be an affiliated person of the \\ncompany except in his or her capacity as a director. \\nD. With respect to service on the Compensation Committee, the board will consider all factors that it deems relevant to \\ndetermining whether a director has a relationship to the company that is material to that director’s ability to be \\nindependent from management in connection with the duties of a Compensation Committee member, including but not \\nlimited to: \\n1. \\nThe source of compensation of the director, including any consulting, advisory or compensatory fee paid by the \\ncompany to the director; and \\n2. \\nWhether the director is affiliated with the company, a subsidiary of the company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of \\nthe company. \\nE. For any other relationship, the determination of whether it would interfere with the director’s exercise of independent \\njudgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities, and consequently whether the director involved is independent, \\nwill be made by directors who satisfy the independence criteria set forth in this section. \\nFor purposes of these independence determinations, “company” and “family member” will have the same meaning as under \\nNasdaq rules. \\nBoard organization \\nBoard and committee meetings \\nDuring 2020, the board held eight meetings. The board has three standing committees described below. The standing \\ncommittees of the board collectively held 19 meetings in 2020.

During 2020, the committee determined that \\nits compensation consultant was independent of the company and had no conflict of interest. \\nThe Compensation Committee considers executive compensation in a multistep process that involves the review of market \\ninformation, performance data and possible compensation levels over several meetings leading to the annual determinations in \\nJanuary. Before setting executive compensation, the committee reviews the total compensation and benefits of the executive \\nofficers and considers the impact that their retirement, or termination under various other scenarios, would have on their \\ncompensation and benefits. \\nThe CEO and the senior vice president responsible for Human Resources, who is an executive officer, are regularly invited to \\nattend meetings of the committee. The CEO is excused from the meeting during any deliberations or vote on his compensation. \\nNo executive officer determines his or her own compensation or the compensation of any other executive officer. As members \\nof the board, the members of the committee receive information concerning the performance of the company during the year \\nand interact with our management. The CEO gives the committee and the board an assessment of his own performance     \\nduring the year just ended. He also reviews the performance of the other executive officers with the committee and makes \\nrecommendations regarding their compensation. The senior vice president responsible for Human Resources assists in the \\npreparation of and reviews the compensation recommendations made to the committee other than for her compensation. \\nThe Compensation Committee’s charter provides that it may delegate its power, authority and rights with respect to TI’s    \\nlong-term incentive plans, employee stock purchase plan and employee benefit plans to (i) one or more committees of the  \\nboard established or delegated authority for that purpose; or (ii) employees or committees of employees except that no such \\ndelegation may be made with respect to compensation of the company’s executive officers. \\nPursuant to that authority, the Compensation Committee has delegated to a special committee established by the board the \\nauthority to, among other things, grant a limited number of stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) under the company’s \\nlong-term incentive plans. The sole member of the special committee is Mr. Templeton. The special committee has no authority \\nto grant, amend or terminate any form of compensation for TI’s executive officers. The Compensation Committee reviews all \\nactivity of the special committee. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 15 \\nGovernance and Stockholder Relations Committee \\nAll members of the GSR Committee are independent. From April 25, 2019, to April 22, 2020, the committee members were \\nMr. Kirk (chair), Ms. Clark and Mr. Sanchez. Since April 23, 2020, the committee members have been Mr. Kirk (chair),       \\nMr. Bluedorn and Mr. Sanchez. The GSR Committee is generally responsible for: \\n� \\nMaking recommendations to the board regarding: \\no \\nThe development and revision of our corporate governance principles. \\no \\nThe size, composition and functioning of the board and board committees. \\no \\nCandidates to fill board positions. \\no \\nNominees to be designated for election as directors. \\no \\nCompensation of board members. \\no \\nOrganization and responsibilities of board committees. \\no \\nSuccession planning by the company. \\no \\nIssues of potential conflicts of interest involving a board member raised under TI’s conflict of interest policy. \\no \\nElection of executive officers of the company. \\no \\nTopics affecting the relationship between the company and stockholders. \\no \\nPublic issues likely to affect the company. \\no \\nResponses to proposals submitted by stockholders. \\n� \\nReviewing: \\no \\nContribution policies of the company and the TI Foundation. \\no \\nScope of activities of the company’s political action committee. \\no \\nRevisions to TI’s code of conduct. \\n� \\nElecting officers of the company other than the executive officers. \\n� \\nOverseeing an annual evaluation of the board and the committee. \\nThe GSR Committee met seven times in 2020. The GSR Committee holds regularly scheduled meetings and reports its \\nactivities to the board. See “Director nomination process” for a discussion of stockholder nominations and recommendations \\nand “Communications with the board” for details on how to contact the board. \\nBoard evaluation process \\nThe board recognizes that a robust and constructive evaluation process is an essential part of good corporate governance and \\nboard effectiveness. The board and committee annual evaluation processes are designed to assess board and committee \\neffectiveness, as well as individual director performance and contribution levels. The results of the evaluations are part of the \\nGSR Committee’s and the board’s consideration in connection with their review of director nominees to ensure the board \\ncontinues to operate effectively.  \\nAnnually, each of our directors completes comprehensive board and committee questionnaires. Each committee oversees its \\nown evaluation process, and the GSR Committee also oversees the board evaluation process. The questionnaires, and ongoing \\nfeedback from individual directors, facilitate a candid assessment of (i) the board and committees’ oversight of risk, strategy \\nand operations; (ii) the board’s culture, leadership structure and mix of director skills, qualifications and experiences; and \\n(iii) board and committee meeting mechanics. Our directors are willing to have honest and difficult conversations as needed \\nduring the evaluation and nomination process. \\nBoard leadership structure \\nThe board’s current leadership structure combines the positions of chairman and CEO and includes a lead director who presides \\nat executive sessions and performs the duties listed below. The board believes that this structure, combined with its other \\npractices (such as (a) including on each board agenda an opportunity for the independent directors to comment on and influence \\nthe proposed strategic agenda for future meetings and (b) holding an executive session of the independent directors at each \\nboard meeting), allows it to maintain the active engagement of independent directors and appropriate oversight of management. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 16 \\nThe lead director is elected by the independent directors annually. The independent directors have elected Mr. Kirk to serve as \\nlead director. The duties of the lead director are to: \\n� \\nPreside at all meetings of the board at which the chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the \\nindependent directors; \\n� \\nServe as liaison between the chairman and the independent directors; \\n� \\nApprove information sent to the board; \\n� \\nApprove meeting agendas for the board; \\n� \\nApprove meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; and \\n� \\nIf requested by major shareholders, ensure that he or she is available for consultation and direct communication. \\nIn addition, the lead director has authority to call meetings of the independent directors. \\nThe board, led by its GSR Committee, regularly reviews the board’s leadership structure. The board’s consideration is guided \\nby two questions: would stockholders be better served and would the board be more effective with a different structure. The \\nboard’s views are informed by a review of the practices of other companies and insight into the preferences of top stockholders, \\nas gathered from face-to-face dialogue and review of published guidelines. The board also considers how board roles and \\ninteractions would change if its leadership structure changed. The board’s goal is for each director to have an equal stake in \\nthe board’s actions and equal accountability to the corporation and its stockholders. \\nThe board continues to believe that there is no uniform solution for a board leadership structure. Indeed, the company has had \\nvarying board leadership models over its history, at times separating the positions of chairman and CEO and at times \\ncombining the two, and now utilizing a lead director. \\nRisk oversight by the board \\nIt is management’s responsibility to assess and manage the various risks TI faces. It is the board’s responsibility to oversee \\nmanagement in this effort. In exercising its oversight, the board has allocated some areas of focus to its committees and has \\nretained areas of focus for itself, as more fully described below. \\nManagement generally views the risks TI faces as falling into the following categories: strategic, operational, financial and \\ncompliance. The board as a whole has oversight responsibility for the company’s strategic and operational risks (e.g., major \\ninitiatives, competitive markets and products, sales and marketing, R&D and cybersecurity). Throughout the year the CEO \\ndiscusses these risks with the board. Additionally, at least once each year, the company’s chief information officer provides \\ninformation on the cybersecurity risks and the company’s approach to protecting the company’s data and systems infrastructure \\nwith the board. In the event of a material cybersecurity event, management would notify the board and, in compliance with our \\nprocedures, determine the timing and extent of the response and public disclosure, and whether any future vulnerabilities       \\nare expected. \\nTI’s Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for financial risk (such as accounting, finance, internal controls and tax \\nstrategy). Oversight responsibility for compliance risk is shared by the board committees. For example, the Audit Committee \\noversees compliance with the company’s code of conduct and finance- and accounting-related laws and policies, as well as the \\ncompany’s compliance program itself; the Compensation Committee oversees compliance with the company’s executive \\ncompensation plans and related laws and policies; and the GSR Committee oversees compliance with governance-related laws \\nand policies, including the company’s corporate governance guidelines. \\nThe Audit Committee oversees the company’s approach to risk management as a whole. The company’s CFO reviews the \\ncompany’s risk management process with the Audit Committee at least annually. In addition, the company’s chief information \\nofficer reviews the company’s information technology systems with the Audit Committee periodically and includes a \\ndiscussion of key cybersecurity risks as appropriate. \\nThe board’s leadership structure is consistent with the board and committees’ roles in risk oversight. As discussed above, the \\nboard has found that its current structure and practices are effective in fully engaging the independent directors. Allocating \\nvarious aspects of risk oversight among the committees provides for similar engagement. Having the chairman and CEO review \\nstrategic and operational risks with the board ensures that the director most knowledgeable about the company, the industry in \\nwhich it operates and the competition and other challenges it faces shares those insights with the board, providing for a \\nthorough and efficient process. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 17 \\nBoard oversight of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters \\nManagement implements ESG-related policies and practices under the board’s oversight, including by (1) establishing broad \\npolicies for guidance of the organization, such as those contained in the document Living our Values: TI’s ambitions, values \\nand code of conduct, which was approved by the board; (2) implementing those policies by delegation of authority and \\nassigning responsibility to board committees, the Chief Executive Officer, and other officers or employees as appropriate; and \\n(3) monitoring and evaluating performance to assure that the stated policies are being followed. \\nWhere ESG-related issues may have significance for TI, these matters are reviewed in the relevant committee. We believe this \\napproach ensures that ESG issues are overseen by the Committee with the appropriate focus. For example, climate-related \\nissues are reviewed with the Audit Committee by the worldwide environmental, safety and health director. The GSR \\nCommittee also oversees ESG matters in connection with its responsibility to review public issues of interest to company \\nstakeholders. Management also provides updates to the GSR Committee at least annually on shareholder policies and proposals \\nregarding ESG matters that are relevant to the company. \\nDirector compensation \\nThe GSR Committee has responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations to the board on compensation for non-\\nemployee directors, with the board making the final determination. The committee has no authority to delegate its responsibility \\nregarding director compensation. In carrying out this responsibility, it is supported by TI’s Human Resources organization. The \\nCEO, the senior vice president responsible for Human Resources and the Secretary review the recommendations made to the \\ncommittee. The CEO also votes, as a member of the board, on the compensation of non-employee directors. \\nThe compensation arrangements in 2020 for the non-employee directors were: \\n� \\nAnnual retainer of $110,000 for board and committee service. \\n� \\nAdditional annual retainer of $35,000 for service as the lead director. \\n� \\nAdditional annual retainer of $30,000 for service as chair of the Audit Committee; $20,000 for service as chair of the \\nCompensation Committee; and $20,000 for service as chair of the GSR Committee. \\n� \\nAnnual grant of a 10-year option to purchase TI common stock pursuant to the terms of the Texas Instruments 2018 \\nDirector Compensation Plan (Director Plan), which was approved by stockholders in April 2018. The grant date value \\nis approximately $100,000, determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model (subject to the board’s ability to \\nadjust the grant downward). These non-qualified options become exercisable in four equal annual installments \\nbeginning on the first anniversary of the grant and also will become fully exercisable in the event of termination of \\nservice following a change in control (as defined in the Director Plan) of TI. If a director’s service terminates due to \\ndeath, disability or ineligibility to stand for re-election under the company’s by-laws, or after the director has \\ncompleted eight years of service, then all outstanding options held by the director shall continue to become exercisable \\nin accordance with their terms. If a director’s service terminates for any other reason, all outstanding options held by \\nthe director shall be exercisable for 30 days after the date of termination, but only to the extent such options were \\nexercisable on the date of termination. \\n� \\nAnnual grant of restricted stock units pursuant to the Director Plan with a grant date value of $100,000 (subject to the \\nboard’s ability to adjust the grant downward). The restricted stock units vest on the fourth anniversary of their date of \\ngrant and upon a change in control as defined in the Director Plan. If a director is not a member of the board on the \\nfourth anniversary of the grant, restricted stock units will nonetheless settle (i.e., the shares will issue) on such \\nanniversary date if the director has completed eight years of service prior to termination or the director’s termination \\nwas due to death, disability or ineligibility to stand for re-election under the company’s by-laws. The director may \\ndefer settlement of the restricted stock units at his or her election. Upon settlement, the director will receive one share \\nof TI common stock for each restricted stock unit. Dividend equivalents are paid on the restricted stock units at the \\nsame rate as dividends on TI common stock. The director may defer receipt of dividend equivalents. \\n� \\n$1,000 per day compensation for other activities designated by the chairman. \\n� \\nA one-time grant of restricted stock units with a grant-date value of approximately $200,000 upon a director’s initial \\nelection to the board. \\n \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 18 \\nThe board has determined that annual grants of equity compensation to non-employee directors will be timed to occur in \\nJanuary when grants are made to our U.S. employees in connection with the annual compensation review process. See “Process \\nfor equity grants” for a discussion regarding the timing of equity compensation grants. \\nIt is against TI policy for any employee, including an executive officer, or director to engage in trading in “puts” (options to sell \\nat a fixed price), “calls” (similar options to buy) or other options or hedging techniques on TI stock specifically designed to \\nlimit losses on TI stock or equity compensation held by the employee or director. It is also against TI policy for directors and \\nexecutive officers to pledge TI stock. \\nDirectors are not paid a fee for meeting attendance, but we reimburse non-employee directors for their travel, lodging and \\nrelated expenses incurred in connection with attending board, committee and stockholders meetings and other designated \\nevents. In addition, non-employee directors may travel on company aircraft to and from these meetings and other designated \\nevents. \\nUnder the Director Plan, some directors have chosen to defer all or part of their cash compensation. These deferred amounts are \\ncredited to either a cash account or stock unit account. Cash accounts earn interest from TI at a rate currently based on Moody’s \\nSeasoned Aaa Corporate Bonds. For 2020, that rate was 3.01%. Stock unit accounts fluctuate in value with the underlying \\nshares of TI common stock, which will be issued after the deferral period. Dividend equivalents are paid on these stock units. \\nDirectors may also defer settlement of the restricted stock units they receive. \\nWe have arrangements with certain customers whereby our employees may purchase consumer products containing TI \\ncomponents at discounted pricing. In addition, the TI Foundation has a matching gift program. In both cases, directors are \\nentitled to participate on the same terms and conditions available to employees. \\nNon-employee directors are not eligible to participate in any TI-sponsored pension plan. \\n2020 director compensation  \\nThe following table shows the compensation of all persons who were non-employee members of the board during 2020 for \\nservices in all capacities to TI in 2020.                                             \\nName \\nFees Earned \\nor Paid in \\nCash ($) (2) \\nStock \\nAwards \\n($) (3) \\nOption \\nAwards \\n($) (4) \\nNon-Equity \\nIncentive Plan \\nCompensation \\n($) \\nChange in \\nPension \\nValue and \\nNon-qualified \\nDeferred \\nCompensation \\nEarnings (5) \\nAll Other \\nCompensation \\n($) (6) \\nTotal ($) \\nM.

It discusses our executive compensation policies and programs and explains the compensation decisions relating to the \\nnamed executive officers for 2020. We believe that the policies and programs serve the interests of our shareholders and that \\nthe compensation received by the named executive officers is commensurate with the performance and strategic position of \\nthe company. \\n Although the outcome of this annual vote is not binding on the company or the board, the Compensation Committee of the \\nboard will consider it when setting future compensation for the executive officers. \\nThe board of directors recommends a vote FOR the annual resolution approving the named executive officer \\ncompensation for 2020, as disclosed in this proxy statement. \\nCompensation discussion and analysis     \\nThis section describes TI’s compensation program for executive officers. It will provide insight into the following: \\n� \\nThe elements of the 2020 compensation program, why we selected them and how they relate to one another; and \\n� \\nHow we determined the amount of compensation for 2020. \\nThe executive officers of TI have the broadest job responsibilities and policy-making authority in the company. We hold    \\nthem accountable for the company’s performance and for maintaining a culture of strong ethics and compliance. Details of \\ncompensation for our CEO, our CFO and the four other highest paid individuals who were executive officers in 2020 \\n(collectively called the “named executive officers”) can be found in the tables following the Compensation Committee report. \\nExecutive summary \\n� \\nTI’s compensation program is structured to pay for performance and deliver rewards that encourage \\nexecutives to think and act in both the short- and long-term interests of our shareholders. The majority of total \\ncompensation for our executives each year comes in the form of variable cash and equity compensation. \\nVariable cash is tied to the short-term performance of the company, and the value of equity is tied to the long-\\nterm performance of the company. We believe our compensation program holds our executive officers \\naccountable for the financial and competitive performance of TI. \\n� \\n2020 compensation decisions for the CEO: \\no \\nBase salary was increased by 3.1 percent over 2019.  \\no \\nThe grant date fair value of equity compensation awarded in 2020 was unchanged from 2019.  \\no \\nThe bonus decision was based primarily on the following performance results in 2020: \\n \\n  \\n2020 Absolute Performance \\n2020 Relative Performance * \\nRevenue growth: Total TI \\n0.5% \\nBelow median \\nProfit from Operations as a % of Revenue (PFO%) \\n40.8% \\nAbove median \\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR) \\n31.7% \\nBelow median \\n \\nYear-on-Year Change in CEO Bonus \\n(2020 bonus compared with 2019) \\n  \\n5% change \\n  \\n* \\nRelative to semiconductor competitors as outlined under “Comparator group;” includes estimates and projections \\nof certain competitors’ financial results. See “Analysis of compensation determinations – Bonus – Assessment of \\n2020 performance” for details of the Compensation Committee’s assessment of TI’s performance. (It is important \\nto note that the median growth rate of competitor companies includes the benefit of acquisitions, whereas TI’s \\ngrowth rate is entirely organic.) \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 21 \\n� \\nOur executive compensation program is designed to encourage executive officers to pursue strategies that serve the \\ninterests of the company and shareholders, and not to promote excessive risk-taking by our executives. It is built on a \\nfoundation of sound corporate governance and includes: \\no \\nExecutive officers do not have employment contracts and are not guaranteed salary increases, bonus amounts or \\nawards of equity compensation. \\no \\nWe have never repriced stock options. We do not grant reload options. We grant equity compensation with \\ndouble-trigger change-in-control terms, which accelerate the vesting of grants only if the grantee has been \\nterminated involuntarily within a limited time after a change in control of the company. \\no \\nBonus and equity compensation awards are subject to claw back as described under “Recoupment policy” below.  \\no \\nWe do not provide excessive perquisites. We provide no tax gross-ups for perquisites. \\no \\nWe do not guarantee a return or provide above-market returns on compensation that has been deferred. \\no \\nPension benefits are calculated on salary and bonus only; the proceeds earned on equity or other performance \\nawards are not part of the pension calculation. \\nDetailed discussion \\nCompensation philosophy and elements \\nFor years, we have run our business and invested in our people and communities with three overarching ambitions in mind. \\nFirst, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever \\nchanging. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our \\nneighbor. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all \\nwin. Central to our ambitions, which are the foundation of our approach to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and \\nsustainability, is a belief that in order for all stakeholders to benefit, the company must grow stronger over the long term. Our \\ncompensation program is structured with these ambitions in mind. \\nThe Compensation Committee of TI’s board of directors is responsible for setting the compensation of all TI executive officers. \\nThe committee consults with the other independent directors and its compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer & Partners, before \\nsetting annual compensation for the executives. The committee chair regularly reports on committee actions at board meetings. \\nIn assessing performance and compensation decisions, the committee does not use formulas, thresholds or multiples. Because \\nmarket conditions can quickly change in our industry, thresholds established at the beginning of a year could prove irrelevant \\nby year-end. The committee believes its approach, which assesses the company’s absolute and relative performance in \\nhindsight after year-end (for the most recent one- and three-year periods), gives it the insight to most effectively and critically \\njudge results and encourages executives to pursue strategies that serve the long-term interests of the company and its \\nshareholders. It also promotes accuracy in our assessment and comparison to competition and eliminates the need for \\nadjustments to formulas, targets or thresholds during times of uncertain market conditions. \\nThe primary elements of our executive compensation program are as follows: \\nNear-term compensation, paid in cash \\n \\nBase Salary \\nPurpose \\nBasic, least variable form of compensation, designed to provide a stable source of income. \\n \\nStrategy \\nGenerally, target market median, giving appropriate consideration to job scope and tenure, to attract and retain \\nhighly qualified executives. \\n \\nTerms \\nPaid twice monthly. \\n \\n \\n \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 22 \\nProfit Sharing \\nPurpose \\nBroad-based program designed to emphasize that each employee contributes to the company’s profitability \\nand can share in it. \\n \\nStrategy \\nPay according to a formula that is the same for all employees to focus them on a company goal, and set pay-\\nout potential at a level that will affect behavior. Profit sharing is paid in addition to any performance bonus \\nawarded for the year. \\nFor the last 16 years, the formula has been based on company-level annual operating profit margin. The \\nformula was set by the TI board. The committee’s practice has been not to adjust amounts earned under the \\nformula. \\n \\nTerms \\nPayable in a single cash payment shortly after the end of the performance year. \\nAs in recent years, the formula for 2020 was: \\n� \\nBelow 10% company-level annual operating profit as a percentage of revenue (“Margin”): no \\nprofit sharing \\n� \\nAt 10% Margin: profit sharing = 2% of base salary \\n� \\nAt Margin above 10%: profit sharing increases by 0.5% of base salary for each percentage point \\nof Margin between 10% and 24%, and 1% of base salary for each percentage point of Margin \\nabove 24%. The maximum profit sharing is 20% of base salary. \\nIn 2020, TI delivered Margin of 40.8%. As a result, all eligible employees, including executive officers, \\nreceived profit sharing of 20% of base salary. \\nPerformance Bonus \\nPurpose \\nTo motivate executives and reward them according to the company’s relative and absolute performance and \\nthe executive’s individual performance. \\n \\nStrategy \\nDetermined primarily on the basis of one-year and three-year company performance on certain measures \\n(revenue growth percent, operating margin and total shareholder return1) as compared with competitors and  \\non our strategic progress in key markets and with customers. These factors have been chosen to reflect our \\nnear-term financial performance as well as our progress in building long-term shareholder value. \\nThe committee aims to pay total cash compensation (base salary, profit sharing and bonus) appropriately \\nabove median if company performance is above that of competitors, and pay total cash compensation \\nappropriately below the median if company performance is below competitors. \\nThe committee does not rely on formulas or performance targets or thresholds. Instead, it uses its judgment \\nbased on its assessment of the factors described above. \\n \\nTerms \\nDetermined by the committee and paid in a single payment after the performance year. \\n \\nLong-term compensation, awarded in equity \\n \\nStock Options and Restricted Stock Units \\nPurpose \\nAlignment with shareholders; long-term focus; balance retention, particularly with respect to restricted stock \\nunits, and performance. \\nStrategy \\nWe grant a combination of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock units, generally targeted at the \\nmedian level of equity compensation awarded to executives in similar positions within the Comparator \\nGroup. The committee does not rely on formulas or performance targets or thresholds. \\nTerms \\nThe terms and conditions of stock options and restricted stock units are summarized under “Outstanding \\nequity awards at fiscal year-end 2020.” The committee’s grant procedures are described under “Process for \\nequity grants.” \\n                                                 \\n1 Total shareholder return refers to the percentage change in the value of a shareholder’s investment in a company over the \\nrelevant time period, as determined by dividends paid and the change in the company’s share price during the period.

The \\ninformation included total cash compensation (salary, profit sharing and projected bonus), the grant date fair value of equity \\ncompensation, the impact (if any) that proposed compensation would have on other compensation elements, and a summary of \\nbenefits that the executives would receive under various termination scenarios. The review enabled the committee to see how \\nvarious compensation elements relate to one another and what impact its decisions would have on the total earnings opportunity \\nof the executives. In assessing the information, the committee did not target a specific level of total compensation or use a \\nformula to allocate compensation among the various elements. Instead, it used its judgment in assessing whether the total was \\nconsistent with the objectives of the program. Based on this review, the committee determined that the level of compensation \\nwas appropriate. \\nBase salary \\nThe committee set the 2020 rate of base salary for the following named executive officers as follows: \\nOfficer \\n2020 Annual Rate \\nChange from 2019 Annual Rate \\nR.

The \\ncommittee’s general objective was to award to those officers equity compensation that had a grant date fair value at \\napproximately the median market level of the most recently disclosed equity compensation granted by the Comparator Group. \\nIn assessing the market level, the committee considered information presented by TI’s Compensation and Benefits organization \\n(prepared using data provided by the committee’s compensation consultant) on the estimated value of the awards expected to \\nbe granted to similarly situated executives (considering job scope and tenure) of companies within the Comparator Group. The \\naward value was estimated using the same methodology used for financial accounting. \\nFor each officer, the committee set the desired grant value. The committee decided to allocate the value equally between \\nrestricted stock units and options for each officer, to give equal emphasis to promoting retention and performance, motivating \\nthe executive and aligning interests with those of shareholders. \\nBefore approving the grants, the committee reviewed the amount of unvested equity compensation held by the officers to assess \\nits retention value. In making this assessment, the committee used its judgment and did not apply any formula, threshold or \\nmaximum. This review did not result in an increase or decrease of the awards. \\nThe exercise price of the options was the closing price of TI stock on January 24, 2020, the second trading day after the \\ncompany released its annual and fourth-quarter financial results for 2019. All grants were made under the Texas Instruments \\n2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which shareholders approved in April 2009 and amended in 2016. \\nAll grants have the terms described under “Outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end 2020.” The differences in the equity \\nawards between the named executive officers were primarily the result of differences in the applicable estimated market level \\nof equity compensation for their positions, and not the application of any formula designed to maintain differentials between \\nthe officers. \\nBonus \\nIn January 2021, the committee set the 2020 bonus compensation for executive officers based on its assessment of 2020 \\nperformance. In setting the bonuses, the committee used the following performance measures to assess the company: \\n� \\nThe relative one-year and three-year performance of TI as compared with competitor companies, as measured by \\no \\nrevenue growth, \\no \\noperating profit as a percentage of revenue, \\no \\ntotal shareholder return, and \\n� \\nThe absolute one-year and three-year performance of TI on the above measures. \\nIn addition, the committee considered strategic progress by reviewing company and strategic positioning, operating \\nperformance, and revenue growth, including TI competitiveness in key markets with core products and technologies and the \\nstrength of relationships with customers. \\nIn the comparison of relative performance, the committee used the following companies (the “competitor companies”): \\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. \\nNVIDIA Corporation \\nAnalog Devices, Inc. \\nNXP Semiconductors N.V. \\nBroadcom Inc. \\nON Semiconductor Corporation \\nInfineon Technologies AG \\nQUALCOMM Incorporated \\nIntel Corporation \\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. \\nMarvell Technology Group Ltd. \\nSTMicroelectronics N.V. \\nMaxim Integrated Products, Inc. \\nXilinx, Inc. \\nMicrochip Technology Incorporated \\n \\nTo the extent the companies had not released financial results for the year or the most recent quarter, the committee based its \\nevaluation on estimates and projections of the companies’ financial results for 2020.  \\nThis list includes both broad-based and niche suppliers that operate in our key markets or offer technology that competes \\nwith our products. The committee considers annually whether the list is still appropriate in terms of revenue, market \\ncapitalization and changes in business activities of the companies. The committee made no changes to the list of \\ncompetitor companies in 2020. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 26 \\nAssessment of 2020 performance \\nThe committee spent extensive time in December and January assessing TI’s results and strategic progress for \\n2020. In setting bonuses, the committee considered quantitative and qualitative measures on both an absolute \\nand relative basis, and the company’s strategic focus on long-term growth of free cash flow per share, and made \\ncertain that resulting decisions were founded on both solid data and sound judgment. On an absolute basis, \\nrevenue and operating profit margin were both positive, with operating profit being better than median relative \\nto competitors while revenue remained below median. TSR was also positive on an absolute basis and below \\nmedian relative to competitors. Free cash flow for the year was $5.5 billion and 38% of revenue. In aggregate, \\nthe committee determined that the company continued to strengthen its strategic position and operating \\nperformance, while also growing 2020 Analog revenue. Therefore, the committee targeted a bonus increase of  \\n5 percent for 2020, except for two named executive officers who were newer to their roles and received higher \\nbonus increases in an effort to more closely align their total cash with the competitive market for their roles and \\nthe company’s performance. Details on the committee’s assessment are below. \\nStrategic progress \\n� \\nOur primary objective is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. To achieve this objective, \\nthe company’s strategy is comprised of having a great business model, a disciplined approach to \\ncapital allocation and a focus on efficiency. \\n� \\nThe company’s business model is designed around four sustainable competitive advantages that in \\ncombination put us in a unique class of companies. These advantages include (i) a strong foundation of \\nmanufacturing and technology, (ii) a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products,  \\n(iii) the reach of our market channels and (iv) diversity and longevity of our products, markets and \\ncustomer positions. In 2020, the company continued to strengthen and leverage these advantages. \\n� \\nThe company’s strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end \\nmarkets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems \\nand other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, the company places additional strategic \\nemphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we \\nbelieve represent the best growth opportunities. In 2020, the company continued the disciplined \\nallocation of R&D spending to strengthen its product portfolio, building on the existing foundation for \\nnear- and long-term results. \\no \\nTI’s broad analog and embedded processing product portfolio includes tens of thousands of \\nproducts, with more products added each year, offering strong differentiation and longevity. In \\n2020, greater than 90 percent of TI’s revenue came from Analog and Embedded Processing \\nsemiconductors. \\no \\nWe believe the industrial and automotive markets represent the best growth opportunity for the \\nindustry for the foreseeable future because of the increasing semiconductor content in these \\nmarkets. In 2020, approximately 57 percent of TI’s revenue came from industrial and automotive \\nmarkets. \\n� \\nTI’s revenue continues to come from a diverse base of thousands of applications. This is an intentional \\nstrategy that prevents dependence on a single market, customer or product. \\n� \\nIn 2020, the company made progress in building closer, direct relationships with its customers to \\nfurther strengthen and extend its reach of market channels. To enable this transition, the company has \\nmade multi-year investments in its sales and applications team, TI.com, business processes, logistics \\nand distribution channel changes. In 2020, the company accelerated these efforts, with the percent of \\ndirect business growing from 37% in 2019 to 48% in 2020, including ending the year with 63% of \\nrevenue direct in December 2020. TI’s reach of market channels provides access to more customers \\nand more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more TI products into each design, \\nand also provides better insight and knowledge of customers’ needs and design trends. \\n� \\nTI’s in-house capability to manufacture high volumes of Analog semiconductors on 300-millimeter \\nwafers remains a competitive advantage due to the inherent cost advantage associated with 300-\\nmillimeter technology versus prior generation. This cost advantage is the result of more chips being \\nproduced per wafer, thereby improving margins and cash generation. In 2020, the company began \\nconstruction of its third 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, located in Richardson, Texas. \\n� \\nIn total, the committee determined that TI’s strategic position was strengthened by management’s \\ndecisions and actions in 2020. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 27 \\nRevenue and margin \\n� \\nAnnual performance \\no \\nTI’s revenue was higher in 2020 than in the prior year, increasing by 0.5 percent, and was below the \\nmedian growth rate of competitor companies. It is important to note that the median growth rate of \\ncompetitor companies includes the benefit of acquisitions, whereas TI’s growth rate is entirely organic. \\no \\nRevenues for the company’s core businesses of Analog and Embedded Processing increased \\n6.5 percent and declined 12.7 percent, respectively. \\no \\nOperating profit margin was 40.8 percent, which was above both the prior year’s margin and the \\nmedian comparison with competitors. \\n� \\nThree-year performance \\no \\nCompound annual revenue growth for 2018-2020 was -1.1 percent, which was below the median \\ncompetitor comparison. It is important to note that the median growth rate of competitor companies \\nincludes the benefit of acquisitions, whereas TI’s growth rate is entirely organic. \\no \\nAverage operating profit for 2018-2020 was 41.1 percent, which was above the median competitor \\ncomparison. \\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) \\n� \\nTSR was 31.7 percent, below the median TSR as compared with competitor companies. \\n� \\nThe company again generated strong cash, with free cash flow at 38 percent of revenue.2 Approximately    \\n109 percent of free cash flow was returned to shareholders in 2020 through share repurchases and dividends. \\nShare repurchases of $2.6 billion reduced outstanding shares by 1.4 percent (net of stock issuances during   \\nthe year). The quarterly dividend rate increased 13.3 percent (the 19th increase in the last 17 years). Share \\nrepurchases and dividend increases are important elements of TI’s capital management strategy. \\n� \\nThe balance sheet remained robust, ending the year with cash and short-term investments of $6.6 billion. \\n� \\nThe three-year compound annual growth rate for TSR was 19.5 percent, slightly below the median  \\ncompetitor comparison. \\nPerformance summary \\n \\n \\n        1-Year \\n     3-Year \\nRevenue growth: total TI .....................................................  \\n    0.5% \\n-1.1% CAGR \\nOperating margin .................................................................  \\n  40.8% \\n41.1% average \\nFree cash flow as % of revenue ...........................................  \\n  38.0% \\n38.9% average \\n% of free cash flow returned to shareholders .......................  \\n108.9% \\n113.0% average \\nIncrease in quarterly dividend rate .......................................  \\n  13.3% \\n64.5% \\nTotal shareholder return (TSR) ............................................  \\n  31.7% \\n19.5% \\nCAGR (compound annual growth rate) is calculated using the formula (Ending Value/Beginning \\nValue)1/number of years minus 1.  \\nOne-year and three-year TSR percentages are obtained from a report generated using a subscription \\nservice to Equilar, an executive compensation and corporate governance data firm. \\nBefore setting the bonuses for the named executive officers, the committee considered the officers’ individual \\nperformance.

In the summary compensation table, the \\n“Salary” column shows the actual salary paid in the year. This table has separate columns for profit sharing and bonus. In the \\nsummary compensation table, profit sharing and bonus are aggregated in the column for “Non-Equity Incentive Plan \\nCompensation,” in accordance with SEC requirements. Please see Notes 1 and 2 to the summary compensation table for \\ninformation about how grant date fair value was calculated. \\nThe “Total” for Mr. Lizardi for 2020 was higher than 2019 primarily due to higher equity awards in 2020, reflecting an effort to \\nalign with the projected market range for similarly situated executives in our comparator group. The “Total” for Mr. Ilan was \\nhigher primarily due to higher equity awards and bonus in 2020. Mr. Ilan assumed chief operating officer responsibilities in \\nAugust 2020. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 29 \\nThe compensation decisions shown above resulted in the following 2020 compensation mix for the named executive officers: \\n \\n                       CEO \\n                              Other NEOs * \\n \\n \\n            *  Average data for the named executive officers other than Mr. Templeton \\nEquity dilution \\nThe Compensation Committee’s goal is to keep net annual dilution from equity compensation under 2 percent. “Net annual \\ndilution” means the number of shares under equity awards granted by the committee each year to all employees (net of award \\nforfeitures) as a percentage of the shares of the company’s outstanding common stock. Equity awards granted in 2020 resulted \\nin 0.5 percent net annual dilution. \\nProcess for equity grants \\nThe Compensation Committee makes grant decisions for equity compensation at its January meeting each year. The dates on \\nwhich these meetings occur are generally set three years in advance. The January meetings of the board and the committee \\ngenerally occur in the week or two before we announce our financial results for the previous quarter and year. \\nOn occasion, the committee may grant stock options or restricted stock units to executives at times other than January. For \\nexample, it has done so in connection with job promotions and for purposes of retention. \\nWe do not back-date stock options or restricted stock units. We do not accelerate or delay the release of information due to \\nplans for making equity grants. \\nIf the committee meeting falls in the same month as the release of the company’s financial results, the committee’s practice is \\nto make grants effective (i) on the second trading day after the results have been released or (ii) on the meeting day if later. In \\nother months, its practice is to make them effective on the day of committee action. The exercise price of stock options is the \\nclosing price of TI stock on the effective date of the grant. \\nRecoupment policy \\nThe committee has a policy concerning recoupment (“clawback”) of executive bonuses and equity compensation. Under the \\npolicy, in the event of a material restatement of TI’s financial results due to misconduct, the committee will review the facts \\nand circumstances and take the actions it considers appropriate with respect to the compensation of any executive officer or \\nsenior vice president whose fraud or willful misconduct contributed to the need for such restatement. Such action may include \\n(a) seeking reimbursement of any bonus paid to such officer exceeding the amount that, in the judgment of the committee, \\nwould have been paid had the financial results been properly reported and (b) seeking to recover profits received by such \\nofficer during the 12 months after the restated period under equity compensation awards. All determinations by the committee \\nwith respect to this policy are final and binding on all interested parties. \\nEquity Compensation\\nBonus\\nProfit Sharing\\nBase Salary\\n22%\\n12%\\n63%\\n3%\\n20%\\n7%\\n71%\\n2%\\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 30 \\nMost recent stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation \\nIn April 2020, our shareholders cast an advisory vote on the company’s executive compensation decisions and policies as \\ndisclosed in the proxy statement issued by the company in March 2020. Approximately 91 percent of the shares voted on the \\nmatter were cast in support of the compensation decisions and policies as disclosed. The committee considered this result and \\ndetermined that it was not necessary at this time to make any material changes to the company’s compensation policies and \\npractices in response to the advisory vote. \\nBenefits \\nRetirement plans \\nThe executive officers participate in our retirement plans under the same rules that apply to other U.S. employees. We maintain \\nthese plans to have a competitive benefits program and for retention. \\nWe have a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan that was closed to new participants in 1997. Then-current participants \\nwere given the choice to continue participating in the plan, or to have their plan benefits frozen (i.e., no benefit increase \\nattributable to years of service or change in eligible earnings) and begin participating in an enhanced defined contribution plan. \\nMessrs. Templeton and Flessner chose to have their benefits frozen. The other named executive officers joined the company \\nafter 1997 and are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan.  \\nThe Internal Revenue Code (IRC) imposes certain limits on the retirement benefits that may be provided under a qualified plan. \\nTo maintain the desired level of benefits, we have non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for participants in the qualified \\npension plan. Under the non-qualified plans, participants receive benefits that would ordinarily be paid under the qualified \\npension plan but for the limitations under the IRC. For additional information about the defined benefit plans, please see “2020 \\npension benefits.” \\nIn general, if an employee who participates in the pension plan (including an employee whose benefits are frozen as described \\nabove) dies after having met the requirements for normal or early retirement, his or her beneficiary will receive a benefit equal \\nto the lump-sum amount that the participant would have received if he or she had retired before death. Having already reached \\nthe age of 55 and at least 20 years of employment, Mr. Templeton is eligible for early retirement under the pension plans.  \\nAll employees who are not accruing benefits in the qualified pension plan are eligible to participate in a defined contribution \\nplan that provides employer matching contributions. All named executive officers participate or participated until their \\nretirement. This plan provides for (i) a fixed employer contribution plus an employer matching contribution for employees \\nhired on or before December 31, 2003 or (ii) an employer matching contribution for employees hired after December 31, 2003. \\nThe committee considers the potential effect on the executives’ retirement benefits when it sets salary and performance bonus \\nlevels. \\nDeferred compensation \\nAny U.S. employee whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level may defer the receipt of a portion \\nof his or her salary, bonus and profit sharing. Rules of the U.S. Department of Labor require that this plan be limited to a select \\ngroup of management or highly compensated employees. The plan allows employees to defer the receipt of their compensation \\nin a tax-efficient manner. Eligible employees include, but are not limited to, the executive officers. We have the plan to be \\ncompetitive with the benefits packages offered by other companies. \\nThe executive officers’ deferred compensation account balances are unsecured and all amounts remain part of the company’s \\noperating assets. The value of the deferred amounts tracks the performance of investment alternatives selected by the \\nparticipant. These alternatives are identical to those offered to participants in the defined contribution plans described above. \\nThe company does not guarantee any minimum return on the amounts deferred. In accordance with SEC rules, no earnings on \\ndeferred compensation are shown in the summary compensation table for 2020 because no “above market” rates were earned \\non deferred amounts in that year. \\nEmployee stock purchase plan  \\nWe have an employee stock purchase plan. Under the plan, which our shareholders approved, all employees in the U.S. and \\ncertain other countries may purchase a limited number of shares of the company’s common stock at a 15 percent discount. The \\nplan is designed to offer the broad-based employee population an opportunity to acquire an equity interest in the company and \\nthereby align their interests with those of shareholders. Consistent with our general approach to benefit programs, executive \\nofficers are also eligible to participate. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 31 \\nHealth-related benefits \\nExecutive officers are eligible under the same plans as all other U.S. employees for medical, dental, vision, disability and life \\ninsurance. These benefits are intended to be competitive with benefits offered in the semiconductor industry. \\nOther benefits \\nExecutive officers receive only a few benefits that are not available to all other U.S. employees. They are eligible for a \\ncompany-paid physical and financial counseling. In addition, the board of directors has determined that for security reasons, it \\nis in the company’s interest to allow Mr. Templeton, at his option, to use company aircraft for personal air travel. Please see \\nFootnote 5 of the summary compensation table for 2020 and “Potential payments upon termination or change in control – \\nTermination – Perquisites” for further details. The company provides no tax gross-ups for perquisites to any of the executive \\nofficers. \\nCompensation following employment termination or change in control \\nNone of the executive officers has an employment contract. Executive officers are eligible for benefits on the same terms as \\nother U.S. employees upon termination of employment or a change in control of the company. The current programs are \\ndescribed under “Potential payments upon termination or change in control.” None of the few additional benefits that the \\nexecutive officers receive continue after termination of employment, except that financial counseling is provided for a \\ntransition period following retirement. The committee reviews the potential impact of these programs before finalizing the \\nannual compensation for the named executive officers. The committee did not raise or lower compensation for 2020 based on \\nthis review. \\nThe Texas Instruments 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan generally establishes double-trigger change-in-control terms for grants \\nmade in 2010 and later years. Under those terms, options become fully exercisable and shares are issued under restricted stock \\nunit awards (to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the IRC) if the grantee is involuntarily terminated within 24 months \\nafter a change in control of TI. These terms are intended to encourage employees to remain with the company through a \\ntransaction while reducing employee uncertainty and distraction in the period leading up to any such event. \\nStock ownership guidelines and policy against hedging \\nOur board of directors has established stock ownership guidelines for executive officers. The guideline for the CEO is six times \\nbase salary and the guideline for other executive officers is three times base salary. Executive officers have five years from \\ntheir election as executive officers to reach these targets. Directly owned shares and restricted stock units count toward \\nsatisfying the guidelines. \\nShort sales of TI stock by our executive officers are prohibited. It is against TI policy for any employee, including an executive \\nofficer, to engage in trading in “puts” (options to sell at a fixed price), “calls” (similar options to buy), or other options or \\nhedging techniques on TI stock. \\nConsideration of tax and accounting treatment of compensation \\nCurrent tax law limits the tax deductibility of annual compensation paid to any publicly held corporation’s “covered \\nemployees,” which includes all of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee considers the impact of this \\ndeductibility limit as one factor in its determination of compensation. \\nWhen setting equity compensation, the committee considers the cost for financial reporting purposes of equity compensation    \\nit intends to grant. Its consideration of the cost of grants made in 2020 is discussed under “Analysis of compensation \\ndeterminations – Equity compensation.” \\nCompensation Committee report \\n \\nThe Compensation Committee of the board of directors has furnished the following report: \\n \\nThe committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) with the company’s \\nmanagement. Based on that review and discussion, the committee has recommended to the board of directors that the CD&A be \\nincluded in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for 2020 and the company’s proxy statement for the 2021 annual \\nmeeting of stockholders. \\n \\nPamela H.

For awards made before 2013, the definition of normal or early retirement eligibility in the \\nrelevant pension plan applies (see “2020 pension benefits”). \\n** This provision is not applicable to grants made after 2012. \\nOptions may be cancelled if, during the two years after employment termination, the grantee competes with TI or solicits TI \\nemployees to work for another company, or if the grantee discloses TI trade secrets. In addition, for options received while the \\ngrantee was an executive officer, the company may reclaim (or “claw back”) profits earned under grants if the officer engages \\nin such conduct. These provisions are intended to strengthen retention and provide a reasonable remedy to TI in case of \\ncompetition, solicitation of our employees or disclosure of our confidential information. \\nOptions become fully vested if the grantee is involuntarily terminated from employment with TI (other than for cause) within \\n24 months after a change in control of TI. “Change in control” is defined as provided in the Texas Instruments 2009 Long-\\nTerm Incentive Plan and occurs upon (i) acquisition of more than 50% of the voting stock or at least 80% of the assets of TI or \\n(ii) change of a majority of the board of directors in a 12-month period unless a majority of the directors then in office endorsed \\nthe appointment or election of the new directors (“Plan definition”). These terms are intended to reduce employee uncertainty \\nand distraction in the period leading up to a change in control, if such an event were to occur.  \\nStock awards \\nThe “Stock Awards” column in the table of outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end 2020 are RSU awards. Each RSU \\nrepresents the right to receive one share of TI common stock on a stated date (the “vesting date”) unless the award is terminated \\nearlier under terms summarized below. In general, the vesting date is approximately four years after the grant date. Each RSU \\nincludes the right to receive dividend equivalents, which are paid annually in cash at a rate equal to the amount paid to \\nstockholders in dividends. \\nThe table below shows the termination provisions of RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2020. \\nEmployment Termination Due to Death or Permanent Disability \\nor at Least Six Months after Grant When Retirement Eligible \\nEmployment Termination  \\nFor Cause \\nOther Circumstances of \\n  Employment Termination \\nVesting continues; shares are paid                      \\nat the scheduled vesting date \\nGrant cancels; no \\nshares are issued \\nGrant cancels; no \\nshares are issued \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 36 \\nThese termination provisions are intended to promote retention. All RSU awards contain cancellation and clawback provisions \\nlike those described above for stock options. The terms provide that, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the IRC, the \\naward vests upon involuntary termination of TI employment within 24 months after a change in control. Change in control is \\nthe Plan definition. These cancellation, clawback and change-in-control terms are intended to conform RSU terms with those of \\nstock options (to the extent permitted by the IRC) and to achieve the objectives described above in the discussion of stock \\noptions. \\nIn addition to the “Stock Awards” shown in the outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end 2020 table, Mr. Templeton holds \\nan award of RSUs that was granted in 1995.

Mr. Templeton and Mr. Flessner chose to \\nparticipate in the defined contribution plan. Accordingly, their accrued pension benefits under the qualified and non-\\nqualified plans were frozen (i.e., they will experience no increase attributable to years of service or change in eligible \\nearnings) as of December 31, 1997. Contributions to the defined contribution plan for Mr. Templeton’s and Mr. \\nFlessner’s benefits are included in the 2020 summary compensation table. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 37 \\n(3) \\nCredited service began on the date the officer became eligible to participate in the plan. Eligibility to participate      \\nbegan on the earlier of 18 months of employment, or January 1 following the completion of one year of employment. \\nAccordingly, Mr. Templeton and Mr. Flessner have been employed by TI for longer than the years of credited service \\nshown in the preceding table. \\n(4) \\nCredited service began on the date the named executive officer became eligible to participate in the TI Employees \\nPension Plan as described in Note 3. \\n(5) \\nThe assumptions and valuation methods used to calculate the present value of the accumulated pension benefits shown \\nare the same as those used by TI for financial reporting purposes and are described in Note 8 to the 2020 financial \\nstatements, except that a named executive officer’s retirement is assumed (in accordance with SEC rules) for purposes of \\nthis table to occur at age 65 and no assumption for termination prior to that date is used. The amount of the lump-sum \\nbenefit earned as of December 31, 2020, is determined using either (i) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \\n(PBGC) interest assumption of 0.00% or (ii) the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) corporate bond yield interest \\nassumption of 2.81% for the TI Employees Pension Plan and 2.90% for the TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plans, \\nwhichever rate produces the higher lump-sum amount. A discount rate assumption of 2.81% for the TI Employees \\nPension Plan and 2.90% for the non-qualified pension plans was used to determine the present value of each lump sum. \\nTI Employees Pension Plan  \\nThe TI Employees Pension Plan is a qualified defined benefit pension plan. See “Benefits – Retirement plans” for a discussion \\nof the origin and purpose of the plan. Employees who joined the U.S. payroll after November 30, 1997, are not eligible to \\nparticipate in this plan. \\nPlan participants are eligible for normal retirement under the terms of the plan at 65 years of age with one year of credited \\nservice. Participants are eligible for early retirement at 55 years of age with 20 years of employment or 60 years of age with \\nfive years of employment. As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Templeton was eligible for early retirement. \\nParticipants may request payment of accrued benefits at termination or any time thereafter. Participants may choose a lump-\\nsum payment or one of six forms of annuity. In order of largest to smallest periodic payment, the forms of annuity are (i) single \\nlife annuity, (ii) 5-year certain and life annuity, (iii) 10-year certain and life annuity, (iv) joint and 50% survivor annuity, \\n(v) joint and 75% survivor annuity and (vi) joint and 100% survivor annuity. Participants who do not request payment will \\nbegin to receive benefits in April of the year after reaching the age of 72 in the form of annuity required under the IRC.  \\nThe pension formula for the qualified plan is intended to provide a participant with an annual retirement benefit equal to \\n1.5 percent multiplied by the product of (i) years of credited service and (ii) the average of the five highest consecutive years of \\nthe participant’s base salary plus bonus up to a limit imposed by the IRS, less a percentage (based on the participant’s year of \\nbirth, when the participant elects to retire and the participant’s years of service with TI) of the amount of compensation on \\nwhich the participant’s Social Security benefit is based.  \\nIf an individual takes early retirement and chooses to begin receiving an annual retirement benefit at that time, such benefit is \\nreduced by an early retirement factor. As a result, the annual benefit is lower than the one the participant would have received \\nat age 65. \\nParticipants whose employment terminates due to disability may choose to receive their accrued benefits at any time prior to \\nage 65. Alternatively, the participant may choose to defer receipt of the accrued benefit until reaching age 65 and then take a \\ndisability benefit. The disability benefit paid at age 65 is based on salary and bonus, years of credited service the participant \\nwould have accrued to age 65 had the participant not become disabled, and disabled status. \\nThe benefit payable in the event of death is based on salary and bonus, years of credited service and age at the time of death, \\nand may be in the form of a lump sum or annuity at the election of the beneficiary. The earliest date of payment is the first day \\nof the second calendar month following the month of death. \\nTI employees non-qualified pension plans \\nTI has two non-qualified pension plans: the TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan (Plan I), which governs amounts earned \\nbefore 2005; and the TI Employees Non-Qualified Pension Plan II (Plan II), which governs amounts earned after 2004. Each is \\na non-qualified defined benefit pension plan. See “Benefits – Retirement plans” for a discussion of the purpose of the plans. As \\nwith the qualified defined benefit pension plan, employees who joined the U.S. payroll after November 30, 1997, are not \\neligible to participate in Plan I or Plan II. Eligibility for normal and early retirement under these plans is the same as under the \\nqualified plan (see above). Benefits are paid in a lump sum. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 38 \\nA participant’s benefits under Plan I and Plan II are calculated using the same formula as described above for the TI Employees \\nPension Plan. However, the IRS limit on the amount of compensation on which a qualified pension benefit may be calculated \\ndoes not apply. Additionally, the IRS limit on the amount of qualified benefit the participant may receive does not apply to \\nthese plans. Once this non-qualified benefit amount has been determined using the formula described above, the individual’s \\nqualified benefit is subtracted from it. The resulting difference is multiplied by an age-based factor to obtain the amount of the \\nlump-sum benefit payable to an individual under the non-qualified plans. \\nAmounts under Plan I will be distributed when payment of the participant’s benefit under the qualified pension plan \\ncommences. Amounts under Plan II will be distributed subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the IRC. Because the \\nnamed executive officers are among the 50 most highly compensated officers of the company, Section 409A of the IRC \\nrequires that they not receive any lump-sum distribution payment under Plan II before the first day of the seventh month \\nfollowing termination of employment. \\nIf a participant terminates due to disability, amounts under Plan I will be distributed when payment of the participant’s benefit \\nunder the qualified plan commences. For amounts under Plan II, distribution is governed by Section 409A of the IRC, and the \\ndisability benefit is reduced to reflect the payment of the benefit prior to age 65. \\nIn the event of death, payment under both plans is based on salary and bonus, years of credited service and age at the time of \\ndeath and will be in the form of a lump sum. The earliest date of payment is the first day of the second calendar month \\nfollowing the month of death. \\nBalances in the plans are unsecured obligations of the company. For amounts under Plan I, in the event of a change in control, \\nthe present value of the individual’s benefit would be paid not later than the month following the month in which the change in \\ncontrol occurred. For such amounts, “change in control” is defined as (i) acquisition of 20% percent of TI common stock other \\nthan through a transaction approved by the board of directors, or (ii) change of a majority of the board of directors in a 24-\\nmonth period unless a majority of the directors then in office have elected or nominated the new directors. For all amounts \\naccrued under this plan, if a sale of substantially all of the assets of the company occurred, the present value of the individual’s \\nbenefit would be distributed in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable following the sale of assets. For amounts under \\nPlan II, no distribution of benefits is triggered by a change in control. \\nTI Employees Survivor Benefit Plan \\nTI’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans provide that upon the death of a retirement-eligible employee, the employee’s \\nbeneficiary receives a payment equal to half of the benefit to which the employee would have been entitled under the pension \\nplans had the employee retired instead of died. We have a survivor benefit plan that pays the beneficiary a lump sum that, when \\nadded to the reduced amounts the beneficiary receives under the pension plans, equals the benefit the employee would have \\nbeen entitled to receive had the employee retired instead of died. Because Mr. Templeton was eligible for early retirement as of \\nDecember 31, 2020, his beneficiaries would be eligible for benefits under the survivor benefit plan if he were to die. \\n2020 non-qualified deferred compensation \\nThe following table shows contributions to each named executive officer’s deferred compensation account in 2020 and the \\naggregate amount of his deferred compensation as of December 31, 2020. \\nName \\nExecutive \\nContributions \\nin Last FY ($) (1) \\nRegistrant \\nContributions \\nin Last FY ($) (2) \\n  Aggregate       \\nEarnings        \\nin Last FY ($) \\nAggregate \\nWithdrawals/ \\nDistributions ($) \\n     Aggregate \\nBalance at Last \\n      FYE ($) (5) \\nR.

Dividend \\nequivalents are paid at the same rate as dividends on TI common stock. \\n(4) \\nConsists of dividend equivalents paid on the RSU award discussed in Note 3 and a $1,076,719 deferred compensation \\nplan account distribution. \\n(5) \\nAll amounts contributed by a named executive officer and by the company in prior years have been reported in the \\nsummary compensation table in previously filed proxy statements in the year earned to the extent he was a named \\nexecutive officer for purposes of the SEC’s executive compensation disclosure. \\n(6) \\nOf this amount, $19,695,600 is attributable to Mr. Templeton’s 1995 RSU award, calculated as described in Note 3. The \\nremainder is the balance of his deferred compensation account. \\nSee “Benefits – Retirement plans” for a discussion of the purpose of the plan. An employee’s deferred compensation account \\ncontains eligible compensation the employee has elected to defer and contributions by the company that are in excess of the \\nIRS limits on (i) contributions the company may make to the enhanced defined contribution plan and (ii) matching \\ncontributions the company may make related to compensation the executive officer deferred into his deferred compensation \\naccount. \\nParticipants in the deferred compensation plan may choose to defer up to (i) 25% of their base salary, (ii) 90% of their \\nperformance bonus and (iii) 90% of profit sharing. Elections to defer compensation must be made in the calendar year prior to \\nthe year in which the compensation will be earned.  \\nDuring 2020, participants could choose to have their deferred compensation mirror the performance of one or more of the \\nfollowing mutual funds, each of which is managed by a third party (these alternatives, which may be changed at any time, are \\nthe same as those offered to participants in the defined contribution plans): BlackRock MSCI ACWI ex-U.S. IMI Index \\nLendable Fund F, Northern Trust Short Term Investment Fund, Northern Trust Aggregate Bond Index Fund-Lending, Northern \\nTrust Russell 1000 Value Index Fund-Lending, Northern Trust Russell 1000 Growth Index Fund-Lending, Northern Trust \\nRussell 2000 Index Fund-Lending, Northern Trust MidCap 400 Index Fund-Lending, BlackRock Equity Index Fund F, \\nBlackRock (EAFE) (Europe, Australia, Far East) Equity Index Fund F, BlackRock Lifepath Index 2020 Fund F, BlackRock \\nLifepath Index 2030 Fund F, BlackRock Lifepath Index 2040 Fund F, BlackRock Lifepath Index 2050 Fund F, BlackRock \\nLifepath Index 2025 Fund F, BlackRock Lifepath Index 2035 Fund F, BlackRock Lifepath Index 2045 Fund F, BlackRock \\nLifepath Index 2055 Fund F, BlackRock Lifepath Index 2060 Fund F and BlackRock Lifepath Index Retirement Fund F.  \\nFrom among the available investment alternatives, participants may change their instructions relating to their deferred \\ncompensation daily. Earnings on a participant’s balance are determined solely by the performance of the investments that the \\nparticipant has chosen. The company does not guarantee any minimum return on investments. A third party administers the \\ncompany’s deferred compensation program.  \\nA participant may request distribution from the plan in the case of an unforeseeable emergency. To obtain an unforeseeable \\nemergency withdrawal, a participant must meet the requirements of Section 409A of the IRC. Otherwise, balances are paid to \\nparticipants pursuant to their distribution elections and are subject to applicable IRC limitations.  \\nAmounts contributed by the company, and amounts earned and deferred by the participant for which there is a valid distribution \\nelection on file, will be distributed in accordance with the participant’s election. Annually participants may elect separate \\ndistribution dates for deferred compensation attributable to a participant’s (i) bonus and profit sharing and (ii) salary. \\nParticipants may elect that these distributions be in the form of a lump sum or annual installments to be paid out over a period \\nof five or ten consecutive years. Amounts for which no valid distribution election is on file will be distributed three years from \\nthe date of deferral.  \\nIn the event of the participant’s death, payment will be in the form of a lump sum and the earliest date of payment is the first \\nday of the second calendar month following the month of death. For any other circumstance resulting in termination of \\nemployment, payments are distributed in accordance with the participant’s valid distribution election.  \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 40 \\nLike the balances under the non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, deferred compensation balances are unsecured \\nobligations of the company. For amounts earned and deferred prior to 2010, a change in control does not trigger a distribution \\nunder the plan. For amounts earned and deferred after 2009, distribution occurs, to the extent permitted by Section 409A of the \\nIRC, if the participant is involuntarily terminated within 24 months after a change in control. Change in control is the Plan \\ndefinition.  \\nPotential payments upon termination or change in control  \\nNone of the named executive officers has an employment contract with the company. They are eligible for benefits on generally \\nthe same terms as other U.S. employees upon termination of employment or change in control of the company. TI does not \\nreimburse executive officers for any income or excise taxes that are payable by the executive as a result of payments relating to \\ntermination or change in control. For a discussion of the impact of these programs on the compensation decisions for 2020, see \\n“Analysis of compensation determinations – Total compensation” and “Compensation following employment termination or \\nchange in control.”  \\nTermination  \\nThe following programs may result in payments to a named executive officer whose employment terminates. Most of these \\nprograms have been discussed above.  \\nBonus  \\nOur policies concerning bonus and the timing of payments are described under “Compensation philosophy and elements.” \\nWhether a bonus would be awarded under other circumstances and in what amount would depend on the facts and \\ncircumstances of termination and is subject to the Compensation Committee’s discretion. If awarded, bonuses are paid by the \\ncompany.  \\nQualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans  \\nThe purposes of these plans are described under “Benefits – Retirement plans.” The formula for determining benefits, the forms \\nof benefit and the timing of payments are described under “2020 pension benefits.” The amounts disbursed under the qualified \\nand non-qualified plans are paid, respectively, by the TI Employees Pension Trust and the company.  \\nSurvivor benefit plan  \\nThe purpose of this plan, along with the formula for determining the amount of benefit, the form of benefit and the timing of \\npayments, are described under “2020 pension benefits – TI Employees Survivor Benefit Plan.” Amounts distributed are paid by \\nthe TI Employees Health Benefit Trust.   \\n Deferred compensation plan  \\nThe purpose of this plan is described under “Benefits – Deferred Compensation.” The amounts payable under this program \\ndepend solely on the performance of investments that the participant has chosen. The timing of payments is discussed under \\n“2020 non-qualified deferred compensation” and except in the case of death, payments are made according to the participant’s \\ndistribution election. Amounts distributed are paid by the company.  \\nEquity compensation  \\nDepending on the circumstances of termination, grantees whose employment terminates may retain the right to exercise \\npreviously granted stock options and receive shares under outstanding RSU awards as described in the discussion following the \\noutstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end 2020 table. RSU awards include a right to receive dividend equivalents. The \\ndividend equivalents are paid annually by the company in a single cash payment after the last dividend payment of the year.  \\nPerquisites  \\nFinancial counseling is provided to executive officers for a transition period following retirement. Otherwise, no perquisites \\ncontinue after termination of employment.  \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 41 \\nIn the case of a resignation pursuant to a separation agreement, employees above a certain job grade level, including executive \\nofficers, might be offered a 12-month paid leave of absence before termination, in exchange for a non-compete and non-\\nsolicitation commitment and a release of claims against the company. The leave period will be credited to years of service \\nunder the pension plans described above. During the leave, the executive officer’s stock options will continue to become \\nexercisable and his or her RSUs will continue to vest. Amounts paid to an individual during a paid leave of absence are not \\ncounted when calculating benefits under the qualified and non-qualified pension plans.  \\nIn the case of a separation agreement in which the executive officer will be at least 50 years old and have at least 10 years \\nof employment with the company on his or her last day of active employment before beginning the paid leave of absence, the \\nseparation agreement will typically include an unpaid leave of absence, to commence at the end of the paid leave and end when \\nthe executive officer has reached age 55 (bridge to retirement). During the bridge to retirement, the executive officer will \\ncontinue to accrue years of service under the qualified and non-qualified pension plans described above. Stock options will \\ncontinue to become exercisable and RSUs will remain in effect.  \\nChange in control  \\nOur only program, plan or arrangement providing benefits triggered by a change in control is the TI Employees Non-Qualified \\nPension Plan. A change in control at December 31, 2020, would have accelerated payment of the balance under that plan. See \\n“2020 pension benefits – TI employees non-qualified pension plans” for a discussion of the purpose of change in control \\nprovisions of that plan as well as the circumstances and the timing of payment.  \\nUpon a change in control there is no acceleration of vesting of stock options and RSUs granted after 2009. Only upon an \\ninvoluntary termination (not for cause) within 24 months after a change in control of TI will the vesting of such stock options \\nand RSUs accelerate. See the discussion following the outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end 2020 table for further \\ninformation concerning change in control provisions relating to stock options and RSUs.  \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 42 \\nThe table below shows as of December 31, 2020, the potential payments upon termination or change in control for each of the \\nnamed executive officers. \\nForm of Compensation \\n      Disability \\n       Death \\n Involuntary \\nTermination \\n   for Cause \\n    Resignation; \\n    Involuntary \\n    Termination \\n        (not for \\n         Cause) \\nRetirement \\n    Change \\n  in Control \\nR.

The \\nannual total compensation of our CEO was $19,081,790. Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation \\nof our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was approximately 258 to 1.   \\nTo identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total \\ncompensation of the “median employee,” we used the following methodology and material assumptions, adjustments and \\nestimates:  \\n• \\nWe selected October 26, 2020, as the date upon which we would identify the “median employee.”  \\n• \\nAs of this date, our employee population consisted of approximately 29,568 individuals working at the company and \\nconsolidated subsidiaries, excluding employees on leaves of absence who are not expected to return to work.  \\n• \\nTo identify the “median employee,” we used base salary and profit sharing information, each of which is paid to all \\nemployees. Salaries were annualized for all permanent employees who were employees for less than the full fiscal \\nyear or who were on an unpaid leave of absence during a portion of the year.  \\n• \\nWe identified and calculated the elements of the median employee’s compensation for 2020 in accordance with the \\nrequirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, including the value of the employee’s health and welfare \\nbenefits (estimated for the employee and the employee’s eligible dependents) and retirement-related benefits.  \\n• \\nWe applied the exchange rate that we utilize in our payroll system, as of the identification date, to convert foreign \\ncurrency to U.S. dollars.  \\nThe annual total compensation of our CEO is the amount reported in the “Total” column of our 2020 summary compensation \\ntable, adding in the value of health and welfare benefits (estimated for our CEO and his eligible dependents) and retirement-\\nrelated benefits. This resulted in annual total compensation for purposes of determining the ratio in the amount of $19,081,790.  \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 44 \\nAudit Committee report  \\nThe Audit Committee of the board of directors has furnished the following report:  \\nAs noted in the committee’s charter, TI management is responsible for preparing the company’s financial statements. The \\ncompany’s independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing the financial statements. The activities of \\nthe committee are in no way designed to supersede or alter those traditional responsibilities. The committee’s role does not \\nprovide any special assurances with regard to TI’s financial statements, nor does it involve a professional evaluation of the \\nquality of the audits performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.  \\nThe committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the independent accounting firm, as appropriate, (1) the \\naudited financial statements and (2) management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and the independent \\naccounting firm’s related opinions.  \\nThe committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young, the required \\ncommunications specified by auditing standards together with guidelines established by the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  \\nThe committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm \\nrequired by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, regarding the independent \\nregistered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed \\nwith Ernst & Young the firm’s independence.  \\nBased on the review and discussions referred to above, the committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited \\nfinancial statements be included in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for 2020 for filing with the SEC. \\nMark A. Blinn, Chair \\nJanet F. Clark \\nJean M. Hobby \\nMichael D. Hsu \\nProposal to ratify appointment of independent registered public accounting firm  \\nThe Audit Committee of the board has the authority and responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention and \\noversight of the work of TI’s independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & \\nYoung LLP to be TI’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2021.  \\nTI has engaged Ernst & Young or a predecessor firm to serve as the company’s independent registered public accounting firm \\nfor over 60 years. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether the \\nannual audit of TI’s financial statements should be conducted by another firm.  \\nThe lead audit partner on the TI engagement serves no more than five consecutive years in that role, in accordance with SEC \\nrules. The Audit Committee Chair and management have direct input into the selection of the lead audit partner.  \\nThe members of the Audit Committee and the board believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young to serve as the \\ncompany’s independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of the company and its investors. Consequently, \\nthe board asks the stockholders to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, \\nthe Audit Committee will consider whether it should appoint another independent registered public accounting firm.  \\nRepresentatives of Ernst & Young are expected to be present and available to respond to appropriate questions at the annual \\nmeeting. They have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so; they have indicated that, as of this date, they do \\nnot.  \\nThe fees for services provided by Ernst & Young to the company are described below:  \\n \\n              2020 \\n                2019 \\nAudit .......................................................................................................................  \\n$ 9,884,000 \\n         $ 9,925,000 \\nAudit-Related .........................................................................................................  \\n$    763,000 \\n         $    796,000 \\nTax ..........................................................................................................................  \\n$ 2,372,000 \\n         $ 1,515,000 \\nAll Other .................................................................................................................  \\n$      29,000 \\n         $      25,000 \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 45 \\nThe services provided were as follows:  \\nAudit: our annual audit, including the audit of internal control over financial reporting, reports on Form 10-Q, assistance with \\npublic debt offerings, statutory audits required internationally and accounting consultations.  \\nAudit-related: including employee benefit plan audits and certification procedures relating to compliance with local-\\ngovernment or other regulatory standards for various non-U.S. subsidiaries.  \\nTax: professional services for tax compliance (preparation and review of income tax returns and other tax-related filings) and \\ntax advice on U.S. and foreign tax matters.  \\nAll Other: TI Foundation audit and training.  \\nPre-approval policy. The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services to be performed by the \\nindependent registered public accounting firm to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the firm’s \\nindependence.  \\nAnnually the independent registered public accounting firm and the director of internal audits present to the Audit Committee \\nservices expected to be performed by the firm over the next 12 months. The Audit Committee reviews and, as it deems \\nappropriate, pre-approves those services. The services and estimated fees are presented to the Audit Committee for \\nconsideration in the following categories: Audit, Audit-related, Tax and All Other (each as defined in Schedule 14A of the \\nSecurities Exchange Act). For each service listed in those categories, the committee receives detailed documentation indicating \\nthe specific services to be provided. The term of any pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit \\nCommittee specifically provides for a different period. The Audit Committee reviews on at least a quarterly basis the services \\nprovided to date by the firm and the fees incurred for those services. The Audit Committee may revise the list of pre-approved \\nservices and related fees from time to time, based on subsequent determinations.  \\nIn order to respond to time-sensitive requests for services that may arise between regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit \\nCommittee, the committee has delegated pre-approval authority to its Chair (the Audit Committee does not delegate to \\nmanagement its responsibilities to pre-approve services). The Chair reports pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee and \\nseeks ratification of such decisions at the Audit Committee’s next scheduled meeting.  \\nThe Audit Committee or its Chair pre-approved all services provided by Ernst & Young during 2020.  \\nThe board of directors recommends a vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the \\ncompany’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2021.  \\nStockholder proposal regarding right to act by written consent \\nMr. John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue #205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278-2453, the beneficial owner of 40 shares of the \\ncompany’s common stock, has given notice that he or his designee intends to present the following nonbinding, advisory \\nproposal at the Annual Meeting. The board of directors opposes the stockholder proposal for the reasons set forth below the \\nproposal. \\nProxies solicited by management will be voted against the stockholder proposal below unless stockholders specify a contrary \\nchoice in their proxies. \\nIn accordance with applicable rules of the SEC, we have set forth Mr. Chevedden’s proposal below. \\nShareholder Right to Act by Written Consent – Proposal 4 \\nShareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by \\nshareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at \\nwhich all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any \\nappropriate topic for written consent. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 46 \\nHundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic won majority shareholder \\nsupport at 13 large companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. This proposal topic also \\nwon 63%-support at Cigna Corp. (CI) in 2019. This proposal topic would have received higher votes than 63% to 67% at these \\ncompanies if more shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. \\nIt is important to adopt this proposal because Texas Instruments shareholders also do not have the right to call a special \\nmeeting. \\nTaking action by written consent in place of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the \\nnormal annual meeting cycle like the election of a new director. \\nIt is also more important than ever to be able to replace a director through written consent because it is almost impossible to get \\na Board of Directors to remove a director who gets a failed vote at the regular annual shareholder meeting. Too many Board of \\nDirectors have found ways to keep marginal directors on the Board who fail to obtain even a minimal 51%-vote when they are \\nthe only candidate. \\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) said it adopted written consent in 2019 after 45%- support (less than a \\nmajority vote) for a written consent shareholder proposal. \\nA shareholder right to act by written consent might be a way to motive some of our poorer performing directors. For instance \\nCarrie Cox and Todd Bluedorn each received more than 297 million against votes at our 2019 annual meeting. This compares \\nunfavorably to the only 2 million against votes that Martin Craighead received. \\nIt is also important to adopt written consent to make up for loss of the right of shareholders to an in- person annual shareholder \\nmeeting. \\nWith the near universal use of internet annual shareholder meetings starting in 2020 shareholders no longer have the right to \\ndiscuss concerns with other shareholders and with their directors at a shareholder meeting which can now be an internet \\nmeeting which is an inferior format to a Zoom meeting. \\nShareholders are also severely restricted in making their views known at internet shareholder meetings because all critical \\nquestions and comments can be screened out at an internet meeting. For instance Goodyear management hit the mute button \\nright in the middle of a formal shareholder proposal presentation at its 2020 shareholder meeting due to a well-deserved critical \\nstatement that Goodyear management did not want to hear. \\nPlease vote yes: \\nShareholder Right to Act by Written Consent - Proposal 4 \\nThe board of directors recommends a vote “AGAINST” this proposal for the following reasons: \\n� \\nWritten consent shortcuts debate on key company decisions and can disenfranchise stockholders. Delaware law \\nand SEC rules provide a meeting framework that promotes informed and deliberate engagement among a company’s \\nstockholders. Action by written consent ignores that framework. When stockholders are asked to take action at a \\nmeeting, those soliciting votes are obligated to provide materials that inform the stockholder of the actions to be \\nconsidered and the consequences of any outcomes. That obligation is not required of written consent solicitations, with \\nthe result that stockholders could be requested to take action without all necessary information and without appropriate \\ntime to deliberate. Written consent further disenfranchises stockholders by eliminating the requirement that all \\nstockholders participate in key corporate decisions. Because only some stockholders need be solicited for their \\nconsent, others lose the opportunity to engage on the requested action.    \\n� \\nStockholders already have several methods through which they can influence company practices without acting \\nby written consent. Primarily, our annual stockholder meeting provides an opportunity for stockholders to provide \\ndirect feedback by voting on director nominees, executive compensation, auditor selection and other matters that come \\nbefore the meeting, or to ask questions of management. If stockholders make the board or management aware of \\nevents warranting stockholder action between annual meetings, the by-laws permit the Chairman, CEO, or Secretary to \\ncall a special meeting of stockholders. Stockholders may also bring specific items of business before the company and \\nother stockholders by submitting proposals for inclusion in the company’s proxy materials to be voted on at the \\nmeeting, or to be voted on at the meeting without being included in company proxy materials. Company by-laws also \\nallow stockholders to nominate directors at the meeting or using proxy access.     \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 47 \\n� \\nWritten consent is unnecessary because our stockholders already communicate with the board of directors and \\nmanagement. TI has a robust investor engagement program that allows stockholders to ask questions of and express \\ntheir opinion to TI management and the board. Our investor relations team regularly engages with stockholders to \\nanswer questions and seek feedback regarding our business operations, both at investor events and meetings as well as \\nthrough direct communication with our investor relations team. As part of TI’s governance, compensation, \\nenvironmental and social outreach program, members of TI management annually engage with top stockholders to \\nlisten to their views and get feedback on these programs. Given these robust engagement opportunities for \\nstockholders, a written consent right is unnecessary. \\n� \\nThe company has been responsive to stockholder feedback it has received through existing communication \\nchannels. Using the communication channels described above, stockholders have provided the company feedback on \\nits practices, and where appropriate, the company has responded. For example, our two directors who received low \\nstockholder support in 2019 due to stockholder concern about their other public company board commitments received \\nmore than 97% in 2020. The increase in stockholder support is attributable to the directors’ reducing their number of \\nnon-TI board commitments, despite the fact that those additional outside commitments were within the company’s \\nestablished guidelines.  \\nFor these reasons, the board of directors recommends a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.  \\nAdditional information  \\nVoting securities  \\nAs stated in the notice of annual meeting, holders of record of the common stock at the close of business on February 22, 2021, \\nmay vote at the meeting or any adjournment of the meeting. As of February 22, 2021, 923,008,297 shares of TI common stock \\nwere outstanding. This is the only class of capital stock entitled to vote at the meeting. Each holder of common stock has one \\nvote for each share held.  \\nSecurity ownership of certain beneficial owners  \\nThe following table shows the only persons who have reported beneficial ownership of more than 5% of the common stock of \\nthe company by virtue of filing a schedule 13G with the SEC. Persons generally “beneficially own” shares if they have the right \\nto either vote those shares or dispose of them.

The policy states that TI directors and \\nexecutive officers should obtain the approvals or ratifications specified below in connection with any related person transaction. \\nThe policy applies to transactions in which:  \\n1. \\nTI or any TI subsidiary is or will be a participant;  \\n2. \\nThe amount involved exceeds or is expected to exceed $120,000 in a fiscal year; and  \\n3. \\nAny of the following (a “related person”) has or will have a direct or indirect interest:  \\n(a) \\nA TI director or executive officer, or an Immediate Family Member of a director or executive officer;  \\n(b) \\nA stockholder owning more than 5% of the common stock of TI or an Immediate Family Member of such \\nstockholder, or, if the 5% stockholder is not a natural person, any person or entity designated in the Form \\n13G or 13D filed under the SEC rules and regulations by the 5% stockholder as having an ownership \\ninterest in TI stock (individually or collectively, a “5% holder”); or  \\n(c) \\nAn entity in which someone listed in (a) above has a 5% or greater ownership interest, by which someone \\nlisted in (a) is employed, or of which someone listed in (a) is a director, principal or partner.  \\nFor purposes of the policy, an “Immediate Family Member” is any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-\\nin-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law or any person (other than a tenant or employee) \\nsharing the household of a TI director, executive officer or 5% holder.  \\nThe policy specifies that a related person transaction includes, but is not limited to, any financial transaction, arrangement or \\nrelationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) or any series of similar transactions or arrangements. \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 50 \\nThe required approvals are as follows:  \\nArrangement Involving: \\nApproval Required by: \\nExecutive officer who is also a member of the TI board, an Immediate \\nFamily Member of such person, or an entity in which any of the \\nforegoing has a 5% or greater ownership interest \\nGSR Committee \\nChair of the GSR Committee, chief compliance officer, any of his or her \\nImmediate Family Members, or an entity in which any of the foregoing \\nhas a 5% or greater ownership interest \\nGSR Committee \\nAny other director or executive officer, an Immediate Family Member of \\nsuch person, or an entity in which any of the foregoing has a 5% or greater \\nownership interest \\nChief Compliance Officer \\nin consultation with the \\nChair of the GSR Committee \\nA 5% holder \\nGSR Committee \\nNo member of the GSR Committee will participate in the consideration of a related person arrangement in which such member \\nor any of his or her Immediate Family Members is the related person.  \\nThe approving body or persons will consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances available to them, including (if \\napplicable) but not limited to: the benefits to the company of the arrangement; the impact on a director’s independence; the \\navailability of other sources for comparable products or services; the terms of the arrangement; and the terms available to \\nunrelated third parties or to employees generally. The primary consideration is whether the transaction between TI and the \\nrelated person (a) was the result of undue influence from the related person or (b) could adversely influence or appear to \\nadversely influence the judgment, decisions or actions of the director or executive officer in meeting TI responsibilities or \\ncreate obligations to other organizations that may come in conflict with responsibilities to TI.  \\nNo related person arrangement will be approved unless it is determined to be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of \\nthe company and its stockholders, as the approving body or persons shall determine in good faith.  \\nThe chief compliance officer will provide periodic reports to the committee on related person transactions. Any related person \\ntransaction brought to the attention of the chief compliance officer or of which the chief compliance officer becomes aware that \\nis not approved pursuant to the process set forth above shall be terminated as soon as practicable.  \\nThe board has determined that the following types of transactions pose little risk of a conflict of interest and therefore has \\ndeemed them approved:  \\n• \\nCompensation paid to a TI director or executive officer for services as such, or where the sole interest in a related \\nperson transaction of a TI director, executive officer or 5% holder is their position as such;  \\n• \\nTransactions where the rates or charges involved are determined by competitive bids, involve the rendering of services \\nas a common or contract carrier, or public utility, at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental \\nauthority;  \\n• \\nTransactions involving services as a bank depository of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture \\nor similar services;  \\n• \\nInterests of a related person arising only from:  \\n�   the direct or indirect ownership in another party to the transaction and that ownership, when combined with the \\nownership of all the other individuals specified in 3(a)-(c) above, is less than 5% of the outstanding equity of such \\nparty;  \\n�   an interest as a limited partner in a partnership, and that ownership interest, when combined with all the other \\nownership interests of the other individuals specified in 3(a)-(c) above, is less than 5% of the total ownership \\ninterest of the limited partnership;  \\n�  \\ntheir position as a director of another corporation or organization;  \\n�   the ownership of TI stock and all holders of that class of stock receive the same benefit on a pro-rata basis;  \\n• \\nTransactions in the ordinary course of business where the only relationship of a TI director or executive officer, or \\ntheir Immediate Family Member, is as an employee (other than an executive officer) and/or less than a 10% beneficial \\nowner of the other entity if (i) the TI director or executive officer is not involved in negotiating the terms of the \\ntransaction and (ii) amounts involved for the fiscal year do not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 2 percent of the \\nentity’s consolidated gross revenues for that year;  \\n', ' \\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT • PAGE 51 \\n• \\nCharitable contributions, grants or endowments by TI or the TI Foundation to an entity where the only relationship of \\nthe TI director or executive officer, or their Immediate Family Member, is as a trustee or employee (other than as an \\nexecutive officer) if the aggregate payments for the fiscal year do not exceed the greater of $200,000 or 2% of the \\nrecipient’s consolidated gross revenues for that year. “Payments” exclude payments arising solely from investments in \\nTI stock, payments under the TI Director Award Program and payments under non-discretionary charitable \\ncontribution matching programs; and  \\n• \\nTransactions involving the employment of an Immediate Family Member of a TI director or executive officer if such \\ndirector or executive officer does not participate in the decisions regarding the hiring, performance evaluation or \\ncompensation of the Immediate Family Member and such hiring, performance evaluation or compensation is \\ndetermined on a basis consistent with TI’s human resources policies.  \\nDuring 2020, two sons of R. Gregory Delagi (Senior Vice President through February 5, 2020) were employed in our facilities \\nand manufacturing organizations. Mr. Delagi was not involved in any decisions regarding his sons’ employment at TI, and their \\ncompensation was consistent with that of similarly situated employees and was determined on a basis consistent with the \\ncompany’s human resources policies. \\nCompensation committee interlocks and insider participation  \\nDuring 2020, Mr. Craighead and Mses. Cox and Patsley served on the Compensation Committee. No committee member \\n(i) was an officer or employee of TI, (ii) was formerly an officer of TI or (iii) had any relationship requiring disclosure under \\nthe SEC’s rules governing disclosure of related person transactions (Item 404 of Regulation S-K). No executive officer of TI \\nserved as a director or member of the compensation committee of another entity, one of whose directors or executive officers \\nserved as a member of our board of directors or a member of the Compensation Committee.  \\nCost of solicitation  \\nThe solicitation is made on behalf of our board of directors. TI will pay the cost of soliciting these proxies. We will reimburse \\nbrokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses they incur in sending these proxy \\nmaterials to you if you are a beneficial holder of our shares.  \\nWithout receiving additional compensation, directors, officers and employees of TI may solicit proxies personally, by \\ntelephone, fax or email, from some stockholders if proxies are not promptly received. We have also hired Georgeson Inc. to \\nassist in the solicitation of proxies at a cost of $12,500 plus out-of-pocket expenses.  \\nStockholder proposals and nominations for 2022  \\nThe table below shows the deadlines for stockholders to submit proposals or director nominations for next year’s annual \\nmeeting. \\n \\nProposals for Inclusion in \\n2022 Proxy Materials \\nDirector Nominees for Inclusion \\nin 2022 Proxy Materials \\n(Proxy Access) \\nOther Proposals/Nominees to be \\nPresented at 2022 Annual Meeting \\n(and Not for Inclusion in \\nProxy Materials) \\nWhen proposal must be \\nreceived by Texas Instruments \\n      On or before \\n      November 9, 2021 \\n No earlier than October 10, \\n 2021, and no later than \\n November 9, 2021 \\n  No earlier than December 18, \\n2021, and no later than           \\nJanuary 22, 2022  \\nProposals are to be sent to: Texas Instruments Incorporated, 12500 TI Boulevard, MS 8658, Dallas, TX 75243, Attn: Secretary.  \\nWe reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take any other appropriate action with respect to any proposal or nomination \\nthat does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.  \\nBenefit plan voting  \\nIf you are a participant in the TI Contribution and 401(k) Savings Plan, or the TI 401(k) Savings Plan, you are a “named \\nfiduciary” under the plans and are entitled to direct the voting of shares allocable to your accounts under these plans.

These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases \\nsuch as TI or its management “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates” or other words or \\nphrases of similar import. Statements herein that describe TI’s business strategy, ability to generate free cash flow in the future, \\noutlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements.

These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance \\nwith generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure calculated by \\nsubtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also \\nreferred to as cash flow from operations). We believe free cash flow and these ratios based on it provide insight into our \\nliquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as \\ninsight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures and \\nare reconciled in the table below to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.  \\n \\n        For Years Ended December 31, \\n \\n \\n \\nFree Cash Flow as a Percentage of Revenue \\n   2020 \\n     2019 \\n \\n   2018 \\n \\n    Total \\n \\n(Millions of dollars) \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\nCash flow from operations (GAAP) ..................................................  \\n$  6,139 \\n $  6,649  \\n$  7,189  \\n $19,977 \\nCapital expenditures ..........................................................................  \\n    (649)  \\n     (847)  \\n (1,131)  \\n(2,627) \\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP) ..............................................................  \\n$  5,490 \\n $  5,802 \\n $  6,058  \\n$17,350\\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\nRevenue .............................................................................................  \\n$14,461  \\n $14,383  \\n$15,784  \\n$44,628 \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n%  \\n \\n  \\n \\nCash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue (GAAP) .......  \\n42.5% \\n      46.2% \\n 45.5% \\n        44.8% \\nFree cash flow as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) ...................  \\n38.0% \\n40.3% \\n    38.4% \\n      38.9% \\n \\n', '(This page intentionally left blank.)\\n', 'Crea\\n12/15\\n12/16\\n12/17\\n12/18\\n12/19\\n12/20\\n$0\\n$50\\n$100\\n$150\\n$200\\n$250\\n$300\\n$350\\n$400\\n12/15\\n12/16\\n12/17\\n12/18\\n12/19\\n12/20\\nCOMPARISON OF FIVE-YEAR CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURN \\n \\nAmong Texas Instruments Incorporated, the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Information Technology Index \\nTexas Instruments Incorporated\\nS&P 500\\nS&P Information Technology\\nOTHER INFORMATION\\nComparison of total shareholder return\\nThis graph compares TI’s total shareholder return with the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Information Technology Index over a\\nﬁve-year period, beginning December 31, 2015, and ending December 31, 2020.

For example, climate-related .issues are reviewed with the Audit Committee by the worldwide environmental, safety and health director.

In terms of research development, stable investments have been shown according to the 3-year data we extracted from the annual report. On the other hand, to benefit shareholders, TI devoted more investments in the ESG-related field so as to increase the equity value and made some repurchased share strategies. To conclude, TI has been successful in responding to the covid-19 crisis and stabilizing the stock price."
