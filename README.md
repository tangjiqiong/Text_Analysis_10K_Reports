# Text_Analysis_10K_Reports

This file is a jupyter notebook with both codes and markdowns for a course-based group project.

Our task was to extract 5-7 key insights from one specific company's 10k reports from quantatitive and qualitative analysis. We extracted text and tables from the 2020 10K report using text slicing and regex in SQL and Python (NLTK) and addressed 5 key questions about risk management, including stock repurchase volume, R&D expenditures, ESG-related policies, cash flow management strategies and COVID-19 plans.
